<span class='large'>IN JUSTIFICATION</span></div>

<p class='c009' >There are several types of intellect, with innumerable
variations and combinations. Some
see but do not observe. They note effects but
look upon them as facts and never seek a cause.
Tides lift and rock their boats but they ask not
why. They stand at Niagara and view with some
outward evidence of delight a stream of water
and an awful abyss, but they lift neither their
thoughts nor their eyes towards the invisible current
of equal volume passing from Nature’s
great evaporator, over Nature’s incomprehensible
transportation system, back to the mountains,
that the rivers may continue to flow to the
sea and yet the sea be not full. That class will
find little in this volume to commend, and much
to criticise.</p>

<p class='c009' >A man is not a pessimist who, when he hears
the roar and sees the funnel-shaped cloud, directs
his children to the pathway leading to the cyclone
cellar. He is not a pessimist who, after noting
forty years of boastful planning, realizes that
war is inevitable, and urges preparedness. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_vi' id='Page_vi'>vi</a></span>
the man is worse than a pessimist—he is a fool—who
stands in front of a cyclone, rejoicing in
the manifestation of the forces of nature, or
faces a world war, expatiating on the greatness
of his country and the patriotism and prowess
of his countrymen.</p>

<p class='c009' >It is commonly believed that Nero fiddled
while Rome burned. Conceding that he did, it
was relatively innocent folly compared to the
way many Americans fiddled, and fiddled, and
fiddled, and fiddled, until Germany was well on
the way to world domination. Coming in at
fabulous cost and incalculable waste, and saving
the situation at the sixtieth minute of the eleventh
hour, we not only claim a full day’s pay
but seem to resent that those who toiled longer,
with no more at stake, are asking that honors
be divided.</p>

<p class='c009' >We are now facing a far worse danger than
the armed hosts of the Central Powers—a frenzied
mob each day extending its influence, and
multiplying its adherents. Shall we again fiddle
and fiddle, and fiddle and fiddle, or shall we
both think and act?</p>

<p class='c009' >For six thousand years the human race has
experimented in governments and only China
boasts of its antiquity. During this period almost
every possible form of government was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_vii' id='Page_vii'>vii</a></span>
tried but nothing stood the test of the ages.
The few surviving pages of the uncertain history
of nations that have existed and are no
more, give ample proof that the task of self-government
is the severest that God in his wisdom
has ever placed upon His children.</p>

<p class='c009' >When this government was launched the world
said it would not endure. It has both existed and
prospered for more than a century and a quarter,
but there is no thinking man between the seas,
and no thinking man beyond the seas, who does
not recognize that representative government, in
the great republic, is still in its experimental
stage. Even Washington declared he dared not
hope that what had been accomplished or anything
he might say would prevent our Nation
from “running the course which has hitherto
marked the destiny of nations.”</p>

<p class='c009' >It is said that when Galusha Grow entered
Congress he carried a letter of introduction to
Thomas Benton, then just concluding his thirty
years of distinguished service. Naturally, Senator
Benton was pleased with the brilliant Pennsylvanian,
for he said to him: “Young man, you have
come too late. All the great problems have been
solved.” Ah! they had not been. Mr. Grow lived
to help solve some; others have since been solved;
more confront us now than ever before in our
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_viii' id='Page_viii'>viii</a></span>
history, and the sky is lurid with their coming.
If we are to continue a great self-governing
and self-governed nation, we must spend some
time in the study of statecraft, the most involved,
the most complex, and, barring human redemption,
the most important subject that ever engaged
the attention of thinking men.</p>

<p class='c009' >About the only subject which vitally affects
all, and yet to which few give serious thought, is
the science of government. Our farms and our
factories, our mills and our mines, together with
current news, much of it frivolous, and little of it
thought-inspiring, engage our attention, but
statecraft, as distinguished from partisan politics,
is accorded scant consideration. In the first
place we are too busy, and, secondly, we do not
improve even our available time. A young New
Englander was asked how his people spent their
long winter evenings. “Oh,” said he, “sometimes
we sit by the fire and think, and sometimes we sit
by the fire.” It is the hope of the author that the
following pages will invite attention to some
problems that in his humble judgment must be
thought out at the fireside, and must be wisely
solved, if we expect to keep our country on the
map, and our flag in the sky until the Heavens
shall be rolled together as a scroll.</p>

<p class='c009' >Recent years have demonstrated the abiding
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_ix' id='Page_ix'>ix</a></span>
patriotism of the American people and their faith
in the ever-increasing greatness of America. Few
there be who would not gladly die for their country.
The only thing they are not willing to do
is to think, and then hold their conduct in obedience
to their judgment. The future of our
blessed land rests with those who can think, who
will think, who can and will grasp a major premise,
a minor premise and drawing a conclusion
therefrom, never desert it.</p>

<p class='c009' >It has become painfully commonplace to say
that the American people can be trusted. While
their good intentions can be relied upon, no nation
will long exist on good intentions. The nations
that have gone from the map have perished
in spite of good intentions. The future of America
rests not in the purity of motives, nor upon
the intelligence, but in the wisdom of its citizens.
In the realm of statecraft some of the most dangerous
characters in history have been intelligent,
pious souls, and some of the safest and wisest have
been unlearned.</p>

<p class='c009' >Socrates taught by asking questions. So far as
possible he who is interested enough to read this
volume will be expected to draw his own conclusions.
The facts stated are historically correct.
What deductions I may have drawn therefrom
is relatively immaterial. The question of primary
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_x' id='Page_x'>x</a></span>
importance to you will be, and is, what conclusions
you draw. And even your conclusions will
be worthless to you and to your country unless
your conduct as a citizen is in some degree influenced
and controlled thereby.</p>

<p class='c009' >From the monument that a grateful people had
erected to a worthy son I read this extract from
a speech he had made in the United States Senate:
“He who saves his country, saves himself,
saves all things, and all things saved bless him;
while he who lets his country perish, dies himself,
lets all things die, and all things dying curse
him!”</p>

  <h2 id='chI' class='c015'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />REPUBLIC VERSUS DEMOCRACY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>Representative government and direct government
compared.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >The Fathers created a republic and not a democracy.
Before you dismiss the thought, examine
your dictionaries again and settle once and
forever that a republic is a government where the
sovereignty resides in the citizens, and is exercised
through representatives chosen by the citizens;
while a democracy is a government where
the sovereignty also resides in the citizens but is
exercised directly, without the intervention of
representatives.</p>

<p class='c009' >Franklin Henry Giddings, Professor of Sociology
of Columbia University, differentiates between
democracy as a form of government, democracy
as a form of the state, and democracy as
a form of society. He says: “Democracy as a
form of government is the actual decision of every
question of legal and executive detail, no less than
of every question of right and policy, by a direct
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
popular vote.” He also says: “Democracy as a
form of the state is popular sovereignty. The
state is democratic when all its people, without
distinction of birth, class or rank, participate in
the making of legal authority. Society is democratic
only when all people, without distinction
of rank or class, participate in the making of public
opinion and of moral authority.”</p>

<p class='c009' >The distinction, briefly and concisely stated, is
this: One is direct government, the other representative
government. Under a democratic form
of government, the people rule, while in a republic
they choose their rulers. In democracies, the
people legislate; in republics, they choose legislators.
In democracies, the people administer the
laws; in republics, they select executives. In
democracies, judicial questions are decided by
popular vote; in republics, judges are selected,
and they, and they only, interpret and construe
laws and render judgments and decrees. I might
add that in republics the people do not instruct
their judges, by referendum or otherwise, how to
decide cases. Unless the citizens respect both the
forms of law and likewise judicial decisions, there
is nothing in a republic worth mentioning.</p>

<p class='c009' >When we speak of individuals and communities
as being democratic, we correctly use the
term. My father’s family, for instance, like all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
New England homes of that period, was very
democratic. It was so democratic that the school
teacher, the hired man and the hired girl ate with
the family. We sat at a common fireside and
joined in conversation and discussed all questions
that arose. It was a very democratic family;
but it was not a democracy. My father managed
that household.</p>

<p class='c009' >In very recent years we have been using the
word “democracy” when we have meant “republic.”
This flippant and unscientific manner of
speaking tends to lax thinking, and is fraught
with danger. A good illustration of careless diction
is found in the old story that Noah Webster
was once overtaken by his wife while kissing the
maid. She exclaimed: “I am surprised!” Whereupon
the great lexicographer rebuked her thus:
“My dear Mrs. Webster, when will you learn to
use the English language correctly? You are
astonished. I’m surprised.”</p>

<p class='c009' >It is a well known fact that the meaning of
words change with usage. Some recent editions
of even the best dictionaries give democracy substantially
the same definition as republic. They
define a republic as a “representative democracy”
and a democracy as a government in which
the people rule through elected representatives.
This gradual change in the meaning of the word
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
would be perfectly harmless if our theory of
government did not also change. Probably our
change of conception of representative government
is largely responsible for the evolution in
the popular use of the word democracy.</p>

<p class='c009' >A far more important reason why the term
“democracy” should not be used improperly lies
in the fact that every bolshevist in Russia and
America, every member of the I. W. W., in the
United States, as well as socialists everywhere,
clamor for democracy. All of these people, many
of them good-intentioned but misguided, understand
exactly what they mean by the term. They
seek no less a democratic form of government as
Professor Giddings defines it, than a democratic
society as he defines that, and likewise financial
and industrial democracy. They want not only
equality before the law, but equality of environment
and equality of rewards. Only socialists,
near-socialists, anarchists and bolsheviki clamor
for “democracy.” Every true American is satisfied
with representative government, and that is
exactly what the term republic means.</p>

<div class='c018'>EQUALITY</div>

<p class='c009' >The expression, “All men are created equal,”
does not signify equality of eyesight, or equality
of physical strength or of personal comeliness.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
Neither does it imply equal aptitude for music,
art or mechanics, equal business foresight or executive
sagacity or statesmanship. Equality before
the law is the only practicable or possible
equality.</p>

<p class='c009' >Why educate, if equality in results is to be the
goal? Why practice thrift, or study efficiency,
if rewards are to be shared independent of merit?
Those who clamor most loudly for equality of
opportunity, have in mind equality of results,
which can be attained only by denying equality
of opportunity. Equal opportunity in a foot race
is secured when the start is even, the track kept
clear and no one is permitted to foul his neighbor.
But equality of results is impossible between contestants
of unequal aptitude when all are given
equality of opportunity.</p>

<p class='c009' >The kind of “democracy” which the socialist
and the anarchist demand, confessedly hobbles the
fleet, hamstrings the athletic and removes all incentive
to efficiency. The keystone of representative
government is rewards according to merit,
and the buttresses that support the arch are freedom
of action on the one side, and justice according
to law on the other.</p>

<p class='c009' >Republics keep a one-price store. Whoever
pays the price, gets the goods. Democracy, on
the contrary, expects voluntary toil, popular sacrifices
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
and then proposes to distribute the resultant
good either <i>pro rata</i> or indiscriminately. No
one can read socialistic literature without recognizing
that political, social, industrial and financial
democracy is the goal of its endeavor. When
the supreme conflict comes between organized
government, organized liberty, organized justice
and bolshevism under whatsoever garb it may
choose to masquerade, I do not intend anyone
shall “shake his gory head” at me and say that I
helped popularize their universal slogan and international
shibboleth. Unless we speedily give
heed we shall be fighting to make America <i>unsafe</i>
for democracy. Then we may have difficulty in
explaining that we have meant all these years a
very different thing than our language has expressed.</p>

  <h2 id='chII' class='c019'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>The republican character of the constitutional
convention, the qualifications of the delegates, and
the extent to which they trusted to the wisdom of
the people.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >The Constitutional Convention was a republican
body, and not a mass meeting. George Washington
presided. He was a delegate from Virginia.
James Madison was another representative
from the same state, and he wrote the greater
part of the Constitution. Thomas Jefferson was
in France, and had nothing whatever to do with
drafting the great document, or in securing its
adoption. Benjamin Franklin was a delegate
from Pennsylvania. Roger Sherman was a representative
of Connecticut. New York sent no
delegate, but Alexander Hamilton, who with
George Washington had early recognized that
the League of Nations, or League of Sovereign
States, which means the same, and which the old
Articles of Confederation created, was proving
an utter failure in practice, and had, therefore,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
urged from the beginning “a more perfect
union,” attended and he was seated as a delegate
from New York. His matchless vision led him
to seek the incorporation of additional safeguards
against bolshevism, as it is now called, and though
his advice was not heeded it was Hamilton, more
than any other man, with John Jay and James
Madison his able supporters, who secured the ratification
of the Constitution as drafted.</p>

<p class='c009' >These, and the other delegates, representing
the people of the several states, after much deliberation
formulated the historic document beginning,
“We the people.” It provides among other
things that its ratification by <i>delegated conventions</i>
in nine of the thirteen states shall make it
binding upon the states so ratifying the same. It
also provides that it can be amended in a similar
<i>delegated convention</i> called at the request of
chosen representatives in the legislatures of two-thirds
of all the states, or by joint resolutions
passed by two-thirds of the representatives of the
people, in Congress assembled, when ratified by
representatives of the people in three-fourths of
the states, in their respective legislatures assembled.</p>

<p class='c009' >Those who talk about “taking the government
back to the people” would do well to remember
that the American people have never voted upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
any provision of the National Constitution, and
there is no way provided by which they can, in any
direct way, express their approval or disapproval.
I repeat, the Fathers created a republic, and not
a democracy. Washington speaks of “the delegated
will of the nation”—never of the popular
wish of the people.</p>

<div class='c018'>THE FATHERS CONSULTED HISTORY</div>

<p class='c009' >The members of the Constitutional Convention
were worthy of their seats. They were men of
both learning and experience. They had read
history. They knew that many attempts at representative
government had been made and that
all had failed. They also knew the path all these
republics had taken on their way to oblivion.
They were fully alive to the fact that the first
step had always been from representative government
to direct government; from direct government
to chaos, from chaos to the man on horseback—the
dictator; thence to monarchy. The discussion
in the convention makes it abundantly
clear that the Fathers sought to save America
from the monarch, and to protect her from the
mass. They chose the middle ground between
two extremes, both fraught with danger.</p>

<p class='c009' >They even went so far as to guarantee that no
state should be cursed with a democratic form of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
government, or a monarchial form of government
or any other kindred system. The provision
is in this language: “The United States shall
guarantee to every state in this Union a republican
form of government.” That excludes every
other form.</p>

<div class='c018'>CONFIDENCE IN THE PEOPLE JUSTIFIED</div>

<p class='c009' >The members of the Constitutional Convention,
having been selected because of their aptitude
for public matters, their knowledge of public
questions and their experience in public affairs,
very naturally had confidence that men of like
caliber and character would always be selected
for important representative positions. They believed
the people would choose legislators, executives
and judges of aptitude, at least, and would
retain them in office until they attained efficiency
through experience.</p>

<p class='c009' >Presumably these delegates anticipated that
men would be born with no aptitude for public
positions, but they confidently believed even these
would be able to select men of aptitude. They
may have realized that some men would be unfit
for Congress, who, nevertheless, would be competent
to select able congressmen. For these, as
well as for other reasons, they provided no way
by which those whom no one would think of sending
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
to Congress, and who naturally give no attention
to public affairs, could instruct their congressmen,
who alone must bear the responsibility
of legislation. Had such a thing as legislating
by referendum been thought of at that time, the
Fathers certainly would have expressly prohibited
it. Legislation by representatives was considered
and express and detailed provision therefor
was made.</p>

<p class='c009' >The preceding differentiation between republic
and democracy has no reference, of course, to
political parties. Long before the republican
party, as now constituted, had an existence, democratic
orators grew eloquent over “republican institutions,”
meaning thereby representative institutions.</p>

<p class='c009' >Every protestant church in America is a republic.
Its affairs are managed by representatives—by
boards. Otherwise there would be no
churches. Every bank and every corporation is
a republic, managed by boards and officers selected
by stockholders. The United States Steel
Corporation, for instance, is analogous to a republic,
the stockholders being the electors, but if the
stockholders were to take charge of that corporation,
and direct its management by initiative or
referendum, it would be in the hands of a receiver
within ninety days.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
The United States of America is a great Corporation,
in which the Stockholder is the Elector.
Stockholders of financial and industrial corporations
desire dividends, which are paid in cash. Not
desiring office, the stockholders are satisfied to
have the corporation managed by representatives
of aptitude and experience. The dividends paid
by political corporations like the United States
and the several states are “liberty and the pursuit
of happiness,” “equality before the law,” an army
and navy for national defense, and courts of justice
for the enforcement of rights and the redress
of wrongs. But stockholders in political corporations
are not always satisfied with these returns.
Some prefer office to dividends payable only in
blessings.</p>

<p class='c009' >In banks and other business corporations,
stockholders are apt to insist that representatives
and officers who show aptitude and efficiency
shall be continued in office so long as dividends
are satisfactory. In political corporations the
people have recently been pursuing a very different
course. They have been changing their representatives
so frequently that efficiency, which results
only from experience, is impossible.</p>

<p class='c009' >While stockholders of a corporation would
certainly wreck the institution if they attempted
to manage its affairs directly or by referendum,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
it is very appropriate for stockholders, acting
on the recommendation of their representatives—the
board of directors—to determine an important
measure like an issue of bonds, or
whether the scope and purpose of the concern
shall be enlarged or its capital increased. Analogous
to this is the determination of governmental
policies at regular elections where the
people choose between the programs of different
political parties as set forth in their platforms.
Thus the people sometimes ratify the policy of
protection, and sometimes the policy of free
trade, demonstrating that they do not always act
wisely by frequently reversing themselves.</p>

<p class='c009' >Political parties usually omit from their platforms
the details of legislation. The only exception
that occurs to me was when every detail
of a financial policy was incorporated in the
platform submitted for ratification. The coinage
was to be “free,” it was to be “unlimited,”
and at the “ratio of 16 to 1.” If the people
had approved this at the polls their representatives
would have had no discretion. There
would have been no room for compromise. While
the people are presumably competent to choose
between policies recommended in the platforms
of political parties, it is a far stretch of the
imagination to suppose that the average citizen
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
is better prepared to determine the details of a
policy than the man he selects to represent him
in the halls of Congress. The congressman who
concedes that his average constituent is better
prepared to pass upon a proposition than he is
necessarily admits in the same breath that his
district committed a serious blunder in sending
him. It ought to have selected a man at least
of average intelligence.</p>

<p class='c009' >The fact that neither stockholders <i>en masse</i>,
nor employees <i>en masse</i> are able to manage a business
enterprise does not imply that the principle
of a republic may not be advantageously applied
to industrial concerns. This question is again
referred to in Chapter <span class='sc'>XXX</span>, and the possible safe,
middle course between the industrial autocracy
demanded by capital, and the industrial democracy
demanded by labor, is suggested and briefly
discussed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>Some fundamental qualifications for statesmanship.
Integrity and wisdom compared.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >How are lawyers obtained? Admission to the
bar does not always produce even an attorney.
And there is a very marked difference between
an attorney and a lawyer. But when a young
man is admitted to the bar who has aptitude for
the law, without which no man can be a lawyer,
industry in the law, without which no man ever
was a lawyer, then with some years of appropriate
environment—the court room and the law
library—a lawyer will be produced into whose
hands you may safely commit your case.</p>

<p class='c009' >How are law makers obtained? Many seem
to think it only necessary to deliver a certificate
of election, and, behold, a constructive statesman,
of either gender. I would like to ask whether, in
your judgment, it requires any less aptitude, any
less industry, or a less period of appropriate environment
to produce a constructive law maker,
than to develop a safe law practitioner.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
I will carry the illustration one step further.
Do you realize that it would be far safer to
place the man of ordinary intelligence upon the
bench, with authority to interpret and enforce the
laws as he finds them written in the book, than to
give him pen and ink and let him draft new laws?
We all recognize that it requires a man of legal
aptitude and experience to interpret laws, but
some seem to assume neither aptitude nor experience
is necessary in a law-maker. If legislators
in state and nation are to be abjectly obedient to
the wish of their constituents, what use can they
make of knowledge and judgment? They will
prove embarrassments, will they not?</p>

<p class='c009' >To interpret the laws requires aptitude improved
by experience; it demands special knowledge,
both of the general law and of the particular
case under discussion. It takes a specialist.</p>

<p class='c009' >I would rather have the ordinary man stand
over my dentist and tell him how to crown my
tooth than to have him stand over my congressman
and tell him how to vote. He knows, in a
general way, how a tooth should be crowned, and
further than that I refuse to carry the illustration.
Then, I can stand a bad tooth better than I can
a bad law. No man ever lost his job because of a
bad tooth. But millions have stood in the bread
line, and other millions will suffer in like manner
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
because of unfortunate and ill-considered legislation.</p>

<div class='c018'>INTEGRITY VERSUS WISDOM</div>

<p class='c009' >We all demand integrity in office, but integrity
is the most common attribute of man. I can go
on the street and buy integrity for a dollar a day,
if it does not require any work; but aptitude, experience
and wisdom are high-priced. If I had to
choose between men of probity but wanting in
aptitude and experience, and men of aptitude and
experience known to be dishonest, I should unhesitatingly
choose the crook rather than the fool;
either for bank president or congressman. Banks
seldom fail because of dishonesty. Banks fail because
of bad management. The thief may steal a
little of the cream but the careless and the inexperienced
spill the milk.</p>

<p class='c009' >Thus far in our history no man has ever walked
the street in vain for work, no man has gone home
to find his wife in rags and his children crying for
bread, because of dishonesty in public office. The
United States can stand extravagance, it can
stand graft, it has stood and is standing the most
reckless abandon in all its financial expenditures.
The worst this nation has yet encountered—and
may the good Lord save us from anything more
dreadful—is incompetency in the halls of legislation.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
Extravagance and graft stalk forth at
noonday when incompetency occupies the seats
intended for statesmen.</p>

<p class='c009' >None but bolsheviki would consider subjecting
an army to democratic command. The personnel
of an army may possess equal patriotism without
possessing equal aptitude for war. Recent
experiences have only emphasized what was said
more than a thousand years ago: “An army of
asses commanded by a lion will overthrow an
army of lions commanded by an ass.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Strange, is it not, that every one should recognize
this principle when applied to an army and
to business, and an overwhelming majority overlook
it when applied to governmental matters?</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c019'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />EXPECTATIONS REALIZED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>The capacity of the people to select representatives
wiser than their constituents illustrated by
historic facts.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >America has passed through several crises, and
each time has been saved because the people’s representatives
were wiser than the people. In this
respect, the expectation of the Fathers has been
realized. I will mention but three instances.</p>

<p class='c009' >During the Civil War the government resorted
to the issuance of paper currency, commonly
called greenbacks. While conservative people
assumed that these greenbacks would be redeemed
whenever the government was able, nevertheless,
there being no express provision for their redemption,
they went to depreciation, and passed from
hand to hand far below par. All this resulted in
inflation which inevitably led to a period of
depression.</p>

<p class='c009' >In this connection it is well to remember that
whenever we have had a period of depression, and
whenever we shall have such a period, there
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
always has been and ever will be a group of people
with a panacea for our ills. During the period
referred to, a political party, calling itself the
“Greenback Party,” came into existence and advocated
the issuance of an indefinite volume of
irredeemable paper currency which, in their ignorance,
they called “money.” The specious
argument was to the effect that when “money”
can be made on a printing press, it is silly to have
less than enough. They expressly advocated issuing
all the currency the people could use without
making any provision for its retirement. Whenever
the people wanted more, they proposed to
print more.</p>

<p class='c009' >Fully seventy-five percent of the American
people, without regard to political affiliation,
favored some phase or degree of “greenbackism.”
While much of this sentiment failed of crystallization,
quite a number of congressmen were elected
on that issue. If the direct primary law, with
which most of the states are now cursed, had been
in force at that time, it is probable that no man
could have been nominated for Congress, by any
party, who was not avowedly in favor of inflation
by some method. But the people were saved
from themselves exactly as the Fathers had anticipated.
The representatives of the people,
being wiser than the people, refused the people
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
what most of them desired and gave them what
they needed, resumption of specie payment.</p>

<p class='c009' >Again, in the ’90’s we had a period of depression,
and the panacea then recommended was the
free and unlimited coinage of silver, at the ratio
of 16 to 1 with gold. The difference between
“greenbackism” and “free silverism” was simply
one of degree. The greenbacker desired the government
to print the dollar mark on a piece of
paper, thus producing currency one hundred percent
fiat, while the free silverite asked that the
government stamp the dollar mark upon a piece
of silver, thus producing currency fifty percent
fiat.</p>

<p class='c009' >Fully nine-tenths of the American people desired
the free and unlimited coinage of silver.
William McKinley, willing as he was to run for
president on a gold standard platform in 1896,
when in Congress had voted for a clean-cut free
silver measure. The lower house of Congress
actually passed a free silver bill. But, exactly
as the Fathers expected, the people’s representatives
in the Senate, wiser than the people who had
placed them there, refused the people what ninety
percent of them wanted and gave them what one
hundred percent needed—sound money.</p>

<p class='c009' >Outside of Russia, there is scarcely a man in all
the world who would now recommend the issuance
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
of irredeemable paper currency, what three-fourths
of the American people wanted in the
’70’s; and there is not more than one man in all
the world who would now recommend the free
coinage of silver, what four-fifths of the American
people wanted in the ’90’s.</p>

<p class='c009' >The direct primary in 1896 would have nominated
a free silver republican, and a free silver
democrat in each and every congressional district
of the United States, and we would have had a
solid free silver House. If the United States
senators had been then elected by the people, preceded
by a direct primary, the Senate of the
United States would have been solidly for free silver;
and we would have passed, as everyone now
recognizes, to financial ruin. We were saved, because
the United States of America was a republic
and not a democracy—because, if you please,
we had representative and not direct government.</p>

<p class='c009' >More recently, Germany and the Central Powers
made war upon the United States. This they
continued for more than two years. Finally, the
President, in his message of April 2, 1917, advised
Congress to “declare the course of the Imperial
German Government to be, in fact, nothing
less than war against the country and the people
of the United States.” A resolution to that effect
was thereupon passed on April 6, 1917.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
If the proposition of going to war with Germany
had been submitted to a direct vote of the
American people, under a referendum, they
would have voted against it, two to one, and in
many localities and cities, four to one. Again
we were saved, because we had a republican and
not a democratic form of government. We were
saved because our representatives proved wiser
than their constituents.</p>

  <h2 id='chV' class='c019'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />INDEPENDENCE OF THE REPRESENTATIVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>The effect of popular instructions to representatives
discussed and illustrated.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >The Fathers never intended that the people
should legislate, interpret the laws or administer
justice. They did provide, however, that the
people should choose their legislators, their
judges and their executives. They sought also to
render impossible any interference with the independence
of these representatives. Judges are
not expected to inquire of bystanders how questions
of law shall be decided, or what decrees shall
be rendered, or what punishments imposed.</p>

<p class='c009' >The Fathers did not anticipate that executives
would hold their ears so close to the ground as to
become nests for crickets. I do not mean to be
understood, however, as intimating that the buzzing
of insects has never been mistaken for the
voice of the people. Members of the House and
the Senate were not supposed to conform to Dooley’s
definition of a statesman: “One who watches
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
the procession until he discovers in which direction
it is moving and then steals the stick from
the drum major.” The Fathers expected officials
to be as independent of the voters who select them
as officers of a corporation are independent of
stockholders.</p>

<p class='c009' >In proof that Washington did not consider
the delegates to the Constitutional Convention
bound to follow the wishes of the people they
represented I cite what Gouverneur Morris
quotes him as saying: “It is too probable that
no plan we propose will be adopted. Perhaps
another dreadful conflict is to be sustained.
If to please the people we offer what we ourselves
disapprove, how can we afterward defend
our work? Let us raise a standard to which
the wise and the honest can repair; the event
is in the hand of God.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Suppose the state should engage in banking.
A doorkeeper, a bookkeeper and a president
would be necessary. But if the president sought
instruction from the street, the bank would be
short-lived. If a body of stockholders were to
enter a bank, as now operated, and demand a loan
without security, either for themselves or for some
needy fellow creature, the president would probably
say, “You can have another president any
day you please, but while I am president, you will
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
furnish collateral.” Otherwise, there would be
no bank.</p>

<p class='c009' >L. Q. C. Lamar used to say to his constituents:
“If you desire me to represent you in Congress, I
will do so.” Then, with becoming dignity and in
absolute harmony with the principles of the republic,
as established by the Fathers, he would
add, “But do not, for a moment, suppose you can
stand between the plow handles during the day
and tell me how to vote.” Evidently Mr. Lamar
expected to study public questions and to be better
informed than his average constituent.</p>

<p class='c009' >Later, the legislature, recognizing his ability,
sent him to the United States Senate. Here he
opposed greenback legislation which was favorably
considered by the people of Mississippi.
Thereupon the legislature passed a resolution demanding
either that he vote in harmony with the
sentiment of his state, or resign. He refused to
do either, but continued to speak, and to vote
his convictions based on knowledge. Before his
term expired, the wisdom of his course was recognized
and he was re-elected to the Senate by the
very men who had sought to direct his action in
a matter wherein they had no jurisdiction and he
had supreme responsibility, and concerning which
they knew nothing, while he knew much.</p>

<p class='c009' >Following the Civil War impeachment proceedings
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
were instituted against Andrew Johnson.
Because of the known prejudices of the people
of Iowa, Senator Grimes of that state was expected
to vote “guilty.” He voted “not guilty,”
and his colleague asked him, “Do you think you
are expressing the sentiment of the people of
Iowa?” The grand old Roman replied: “I have
not inquired concerning the sentiment of the people
of Iowa. I vote my convictions.” That would
be political suicide today.</p>

<p class='c009' >A few years ago proceedings to expel a certain
senator were pending and several of his associates,
after hearing the evidence submitted to them in
their judicial capacity, expressed the conviction
that the accused was innocent, but, because of the
prejudices of their states, they would have to vote
for expulsion. Senator Depew told me of a member
who actually cried as he contemplated voting
to expel a man whom he believed to be innocent.</p>

<p class='c009' >I would like to ask how long you think the
United States of America can maintain her proud
position among the nations of the world, if oath-bound
representatives of the people accept popular
sentiment as the guide of their official conduct.</p>

<p class='c009' >At the unveiling of the monument to Elijah
Lovejoy, a letter was read from Wendel Phillips
containing this sentence: “How cautiously most
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
slip into oblivion and are forgotten, while here
and there a man forgets himself into immortality.”
In these most trying times our greatest
need is men in public life whose ears are always
open to counsel but ever closed to clamor—who
will approach pending problems that threaten our
very existence, with no other care but their country’s
weal. The corner stone of freedom, as laid
by the Fathers, is the absolute independence of
the representative, coupled with the unimpeded
right of the people to choose again at brief but
appropriate intervals.</p>

<div class='c018'>HOW WOULD YOU BUILD A SUBMARINE?</div>

<p class='c009' >Suppose the government should delegate to
some congressional district the responsibility of
building a submarine. Would anyone think of
undertaking the task except on the principle of
a republic? You would select some man of mechanical
aptitude, plus mechanical experience,
and you would hold him responsible for the result.
Would you require your representative when selected
to listen to popular sentiment, as expressed
on the street corners or in the press? Would you
have him submit his plans and blue prints to the
“people,” by referendum or otherwise?</p>

<p class='c009' >We all admit that some men know more about
farming than others, some more about commerce
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
than others, some more about science than others,
but the sentiment is alarmingly general that in the
realm of statecraft—the most complex subject
ever approached—one man is just as wise as
another. At Detroit, Michigan, during the campaign
of 1916, Woodrow Wilson used this language:
“So I say the suspicion is beginning to
dawn in many quarters, that the average man
knows the business necessities of the country just
as well as the extraordinary man.”</p>

<p class='c009' >I do not wish to question Mr. Wilson’s sincerity,
though I am not unmindful of the fact that
he spent the greater part of his active life in college
work trying to produce “extraordinary
men,” and in that field he was quite successful.
Taking issue with his position, but not with his
sincerity, I am going to insult popular sentiment
and say that I believe there are many men competent
to select a competent constructor of a submarine,
who are not competent to construct a submarine,
or competent to instruct a constructor of
a submarine.</p>

<p class='c009' >But, suppose the people should build such a
craft on the principle of a democracy, each one
doing what seemed to him wise, without dishonesty
or graft. I have no question but that a submarine
would be produced that would “sub,” and
I am equally certain that it would stay “subbed.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
I want to ask whether, in your opinion, the ship
of state—the government of the United States—is
any less complicated, any less complex or any
less likely to “sub” and stay “subbed,” exactly as
each and every republic for twenty-five hundred
years did “sub”—if placed in the hands of an inexperienced
mass of experimenters in statecraft.</p>

<p class='c009' >Think this out for yourself. This is your government
quite as much as mine, and it will be your
government long after the conservative “Old
Guard” have left the field of human activities.</p>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>A consideration of the constitutional guarantee

<p class='c017' >Both the trend of thought and the current of

and toward direct government.</p>

<p class='c009' >Legislating by initiative or by referendum, the
recall of judges, and especially the recall of judicial
decisions, come dangerously near constituting
a democratic form of government, against which
the Constitution of the United States guarantees.
Its language you remember: “The United States
shall guarantee to every state in this Union a
republican form of government.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Chief Justice Taney, interpreting this section,
said: “It rests with Congress to decide what
government is the established one in a state, for,
as the United States guarantees to each state a
republican form of government, Congress must
necessarily decide what government is established
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>

<p class='c009' >Chief Justice Waite used the following language,
the vital sentence of which I have italicized:
“All the states had governments when the
Constitution was adopted. In all, the people participated,
to some extent, <i>through their representatives
selected in the manner specially provided</i>.
These governments the Constitution did not
change. They were accepted precisely as they
were and it is therefore to be presumed that they
were such as it is the duty of the states to provide.
Thus, we have unmistakable evidence of what was
republican in form within the meaning of that
term as employed in the Constitution.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c020'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009' >It is well to note that this participation in their
government, which the learned Chief Justice mentions,
was “<i>through their representatives</i>,” and in
no other way.</p>

<p class='c009' >More than one state has been required to
change its constitution before admission into the
Union. Congress refused to admit Arizona under
a constitution providing for the recall of
judges and judicial decisions. It smacked too
strongly of direct government. After her admission,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
however, she amended her constitution and
inserted the socialistic—the “democratic”—provisions,
the elimination of which Congress had made
a condition precedent to admission.</p>

<p class='c009' >In his work, “The State,” Woodrow Wilson
calls attention to the fact that constitution-making
is fast becoming “a cumbrous mode of legislation.”
The record in many states justifies this
comment.</p>

<p class='c009' >At the election of 1918, in the state of California
there were submitted through referendum
nineteen proposed amendments to its constitution,
no one of which legitimately belongs in a constitution.
They were simply legislative acts sought to
be inserted in the organic law, or state charter,
for the sole purpose of rendering them more difficult
of repeal when proved bad. The “people”
had so little confidence in themselves that they
deemed it imprudent to trust to their wisdom
whether a law should be continued when found
beneficial or repealed when its effects were evil,
and hence sought to tie their own hands by placing
the act in the constitution instead of in the revised
statutes.</p>

<p class='c009' >George Washington, with prophetic vision,
foresaw and in his immortal Farewell Address
warned against this tendency towards evolutionary
revolution and employed this language, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
last sentence of which I feel certain he would
today italicize:</p>

<p class='c009' >“Towards the preservation of your government
and the permanency of your present happy state,
it is requisite not only that you speedily discountenance
irregular opposition to its acknowledged
authority, but also that you resist with care the
spirit of innovation upon its principles, however
specious the pretext. <i>One method of assault may
be to effect in the forms of the Constitution alterations
which will impair the energy of the system
and thus to undermine what cannot be directly
overthrown.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009' >This trend towards a democratic form of government,
or direct government, finds fitting illustration
in the fact that if you were to locate a
homestead in any one of several states, prove up
and secure your patent, and someone should contest
your title, and the court should find the land
belonged to you, and should render decision accordingly,
the people might reverse this decree
and give the land to the contestant. It is not a
question whether they are likely to do such a
thing. The fact that the people in several states
have deliberately provided the machinery by
which they can thus defeat justice, constitutes a
perpetual menace that should adversely affect the
market value of all real estate in those states.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
When title to property is made to rest upon the
sentimental whim of the masses, as distinguished
from a decree of court, liberty itself is
rendered unstable and organized government is
abandoned and socialism is substituted.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>The necessity for organized government and
organized justice as a guarantee of constitutional
liberty is sought to be shown. Plato’s dream,
Macaulay’s dire prediction and a threat.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >A democratic form of government precludes
the possibility of constitutional liberty. Constitutional
liberty does exist in what Professor
Giddings calls a “democratic state,” but cannot
in what the same author calls a “democratic
form of government.” His admittedly correct
differentiation cannot be too often repeated.</p>

<p class='c009' >“A democratic state,” says this high authority,
“is popular sovereignty,” while “a democratic
form of government is the actual decision of every
question of legal and executive detail by a direct
popular vote.”</p>

<p class='c009' >I grant the formality of a constitution may
exist under a democratic form of government, but
where all functions of government are exercised
directly by the people, necessarily there can be no
tribunal to enforce the provisions of a constitution.
Let me illustrate.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
Suppose, if you will, that an uninhabited island
has been discovered, and a government is about
to be formulated preliminary to its occupation.
Undoubtedly, we would agree that the sovereignty
of the island should be vested in the people.
This, according to Professor Giddings,
would make it a “democratic state.” The next
question would be whether this sovereignty would
be exercised directly or through representatives.
Shall it be a democratic form of government, or
a republican form of government?</p>

<p class='c009' >Someone would propose that a majority should
rule. If I were present, I would promptly suggest
that the rights of majorities always have
been, and always will be, secure. Minorities, not
majorities, need protection. I would ask what
protection is to be given me, or anyone who may
prove an undesirable citizen. Will we be thrown
into jail and kept there indefinitely, without trial
and without knowing the cause of our incarceration?
Such wrongs were common for centuries
and are perpetrated by bolshevists, and defended
by socialists today. Very likely the assembly
would then promise a speedy trial, with right to
summon witnesses, and to be confronted by one’s
accusers, and other safeguards of liberty such as
are now guaranteed in the Constitution of the
United States, and that of every state.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
But this would not satisfy me. I would ask
“How do I know that this promise will be kept?”
Then, doubtless, the right to a writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i> would be promised. And this would not
satisfy me. I would ask: “By whom will it be
issued, and by whom enforced?” Before we were
through, it is quite probable we would create a
tribunal, clothe it with greatest dignity, segregate
it from the affairs of business and safeguard it
against political influence, and for want of a better
name, we would call it “The Supreme Court
of the Island.” This court would be clothed with
authority to grant and enforce not only writs of
<i>habeas corpus</i> but any and all other orders and
decrees and judgments necessary to protect the
minority, even though a minority of one, in his
every constitutional right.</p>

<div class='c018'>TREASON AS AN ILLUSTRATION</div>

<p class='c009' >Treason is the only crime defined in the Constitution.
Prior to the year 1352 there was great
uncertainty in England as to what constituted
treason, and Parliament, for the purpose of restraining
the power of the Crown to oppress the
subject by arbitrary construction, passed, in that
year, what is commonly known as the “Statute of
Treason.” All acts that might be construed treasonable
were classified under seven branches. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>
framers of the Constitution, desiring to protect
the minority, chose only one of the seven and
placed a perpetual bar against any other act being
made treason, and further safeguarded the
minority by defining the only basis of conviction.
Section 3, Article III, is as follows:</p>

<p class='c009' >“Treason against the United States shall consist
only in levying war against them, or in adhering
to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.
No person shall be convicted of treason
unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the
same overt act, or on confession in open court.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Now, suppose confiscationists, whether styling
themselves socialists, bolsheviki, single-taxers, or
non-partisan leaguers, shall get control and, by
referendum, extend the scope of treason to include
such offenses as claiming title to real estate,
which all the breed insist rightfully belongs to the
people <i>en masse</i>. Far less degrees of what they
consider “crime” were made punishable by death
when democracy went mad in France. Of what
use would the express provisions of the Constitution
be if the power to recall decisions, as well as
the judges who render them, is to be exercised by
the mass?</p>

<p class='c009' >Leave it to the people to afford protection from
the people and you might just as well abolish all
constitutional guarantees. Were the people <i>en</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
<i>masse</i> to make the laws, <i>en masse</i> to interpret the
laws, and <i>en masse</i> to enforce the laws, the individual
would have no rights that the people <i>en
masse</i> would be bound to respect.</p>

<div class='c018'>SOVIET RUSSIA AND AMERICAN REVOLUTION</div>

<p class='c009' >In a widely circulated pamphlet, “A Voice Out
of Russia,” the author speaks of “a certain divine
sense in which the Russian revolution parallels
the revolt of the thirteen American colonies, and
in which the proletariat of Russia is striving to
accomplish for his world much the same ideals
which our forefathers laid down for theirs.
There was,” he says, “more of the spirit of the
people, more of faith and dependence in the proletariat,
in American revolutionary doctrines,
than we seem disposed to admit today; and by the
same token, it is because we have lost our sense
of fundamental democracy that we do not care to
admit it.”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Fundamental democracy” is the correct term.
But we have not lost it. We are simply in danger
of getting it. It is exactly what the Fathers
sought to eliminate and prevent.</p>

<p class='c009' >On the next page of the pamphlet, the author
says: “The writers of the American Constitution
certainly strove to do away with the artificial complexities
of politics, and to bring every function
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
of government within the grasp and comprehension
of the whole electorate.”</p>

<p class='c009' >I submit that that is exactly what the framers
of the Constitution did not seek to do. They created
representative government and sought to
guard against direct government. The author
quoted, and every other teacher of revolution,
either by peaceful or violent means, is seeking to
establish direct government. When they use the
word “democracy,” they use it in its dictionary
sense. They use it as Rousseau, Robespierre,
Lenine, Trotsky and a very large number of
others, including some widely known Americans,
use it. Why do liberty-loving Americans seek
to divorce the word “democracy” from its original
meaning and popularize the greatest enemy liberty
has ever known?</p>

<div class='c018'>PLATO’S DREAM</div>

<p class='c009' >One of the best and most conservative newspapers
in the United States printed late in 1918
a carefully written editorial under the above title,
from which I quote a few disconnected sentences,
italicizing the most important:</p>

<p class='c009' >“Twenty-five hundred years ago in Athens,
Plato, the philosopher, who is called the ‘father
of idealists,’ framed the structure of an ideal government
among men, in the form of a republic.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
... When the dust of Plato was gathered
into a Grecian urn, his dream did not die. The
generations harbored and treasured it. Time
after time, and in place after place, republics were
formed. Men gave their blood and their lives to
realize the dream of Plato. But always might
prevailed over them. Only America endured to
make the dream come true. In these times there
are numerous republics but there is not one among
them that does not owe its existence to the example
and the influence of the United States. Were
our republic to crumble, every other on earth
would crumble with it.... Since the
adoption of the Constitution in 1789, one hundred
and thirty years have passed and <i>during that time
America has met and overcome every trial to
which the ideal republic could possibly be subjected</i>.
It has answered every argument against
a republican form of government advanced by the
most stubborn objectors.”</p>

<p class='c009' >The foregoing is historically correct except the
last two sentences. America has stood every test
except that which ruined every other republic. It
has not yet encountered <i>direct government</i>, towards
which we seem radically tending. It has
not withstood what Lord Macauley, a century
ago, predicted would prove our overthrow. He
declared the republic was “all sail and no ballast.”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
He predicted great speed for a period; but he
warned against the day when those who did not
have breakfast and did not expect dinner would
elect our congress and our president. The
demagogue would be abroad in the land and he
would say: “Why do these have and you suffer?”</p>

<p class='c009' >“Your republic will be pillaged and ravaged in
the 20th century, just as the Roman Empire was
by the barbarians of the fifth century, with this
difference, that the devastators of the Roman
Empire, the Huns and Vandals, came from
abroad, while your barbarians will be the people
of your own country, and the product of your own
institutions.”</p>

<p class='c009' >If “Coxie’s army” had been led by Eugene
Debs, or any one of more than a score whose
names are revered by many, instead of by a
patriotic American, every mile of the road over
which it traveled would have reeked with human
gore. Had it resorted to bloodshed at that time,
however, it would not have proceeded far. But
socialism has made great progress since 1895.</p>

<p class='c009' >Speaking before a Senate committee early in
January of this year, the president of the American
Federation of Labor is reported to have said:
“The people will not countenance industrial stagnation
after the war. There can be no repetition
in the United States of the conditions that prevailed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
from 1893 to 1896 when men and women
were hungry for the want of employment.”</p>

<p class='c009' >The same veiled threat has been uttered repeatedly
by men high in official position.</p>

<p class='c009' >Are we face to face with a condition and not
a theory? Will laborers revolt if they fail to secure
employment, or when compelled to accept a
lesser wage? Will farmers turn anarchist if they
can find no market for their crops, or when compelled
to accept a lesser price? Will bankers
become bomb throwers if unloanable funds accumulate?
No, America has not withstood every
trial to which she can possibly be subjected. The
supreme menace stands today with gnashing
teeth, glaring into our faces.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>The nature of the constitution and the dependence
of the minority thereon and hence the necessity
for an independent judiciary discussed and
illustrated.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >A constitution is little less than a firm and
binding contract between the majority and the
minority, entered into for the sole protection of
the minority, with regularly constituted courts to
enforce its provisions.</p>

<p class='c009' >The Supreme Court of the United States, from
which every root of the Judiciary Department—one
of the three coordinate branches of government—derives
its vitality, is our only continuing
and unchanging bulwark of liberty.</p>

<p class='c009' >The executive branch, from President down
through all the departments, State, Treasury,
War and Navy, is liable to radical change on the
fourth day of March every four years. Either
house and both houses of Congress frequently
change in partisan complexion at a single election.
The Supreme Court, the members of which hold
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
by life tenure, remains, theoretically, at least,
unchanged.</p>

<p class='c009' >Unless the people undermine their liberties by
“effecting in the forms of the Constitution alterations
which will impair the energy of the system,”
which Washington warned against, or unless some
executive corrupts the personnel of the Supreme
Court by filling vacancies with socialists, or other
revolutionary elements, Anglican liberty, the
hope of the world, is secured in America against
everything except bolshevism. With respect to
the courts, Washington’s famous order is pertinent:
“Place none but Americans on guard
tonight.”</p>

<div class='c018'>WHO IS AN AMERICAN?</div>

<p class='c009' >Who is an American, worthy to be placed on
guard tonight? Is he American born? He may
be, and he may have been born beneath any flag
and under any sky. An American is one who
believes in and is ready to defend this <i>republic</i>.
To be ready to defend our territory, or even our
flag, is not enough.</p>

<p class='c009' >Though we continue our socialistic bent and
either undermine or overthrow our form of government
through peaceful evolution or forceful
revolution, with sword or by ballot, the land will
remain. The rains will water it, the sun warm
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
it, human life will exist, the Stars and Stripes
will still float, but, except from the map, America
will be gone forever.</p>

<p class='c009' >America is more than fertile fields, more than
bursting banks, more than waving flags. The
America in which one must believe, and for which
he must sacrifice, is constitutional liberty and
justice according to law, guaranteed and administered
by three coordinate branches of government.
Just in proportion as we weaken the
energy of the system through changes in the
Constitution—which Washington so earnestly
warned against—we undermine what thus far no
one has succeeded in overthrowing.</p>

<p class='c009' >I repeat, three coordinate branches of government
with no subordinate branch! In the
America which the world knows, and which we
love, laws must be enacted by the legislative
branch, and not by the executive or by the proletariat.
Laws must be interpreted by an independent
judiciary, fearless and unrecallable
except by impeachment. And these laws, whose
scope is limited by the Constitution, must be
administered by the executive and not by the
legislative branch. Congress has no more right
to direct the manner of execution of its acts than
the president has to direct or coerce the nature
of its acts. Let each coordinate branch keep
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
hands off the sacred prerogatives of the other.
That’s America! And the man who defends
her traditions and her institutions, regardless of
his nativity, is an American who can safely be
placed on guard tonight.</p>

<div class='c018'>AN ACTUAL MENACE</div>

<p class='c009' >On February 3, 1919, an editorial writer who
has testified that he has six million or more readers,
quoted Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, as saying:</p>

<p class='c009' >“I mean that the people propose to control
their government and do not intend any longer
to have the governing power exercised by judges
on the bench.”</p>

<p class='c009' >And the editor correctly adds:</p>

<p class='c009' >“This is as near to an American revolutionary
statement as has ever come from a man as important
officially as Mr. Gompers.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Thus the issue is sharply drawn. This organization,
if its president has been correctly quoted,
intends to abolish one of our coordinate branches
of government, to-wit, the courts.</p>

<p class='c009' >What have the courts done to justify such a
radical change in our form of government?
When the government was organized the Fathers
thought wise to make express provision that no
class should ever become the special favorite of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
legislation. The Constitution forbids class legislation
and the courts enforce it. Unless labor
union people demand special exemptions from
obligations to which all others are amenable, or
special privileges denied to others, why do they
officially make the revolutionary announcement
that the courts are to be abolished? Yet this very
thing has the approval of this most widely known
and best-paid editorial writer in the world.
Pressed in a corner, I presume both would claim
that their only desire is to compel the courts
promptly to observe popular sentiment instead of
studying legal principles and, to that end, propose
to subject judges to some kind of recall.
And they would doubtless justify all this by the
hackneyed phrase, “the people can be trusted.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Thus they follow Rousseau and Robespierre.
The former declared, “The general will, the public
will, is always right.” The latter said, “The
people is infallible.”</p>

<p class='c009' >A case that well illustrates this “popular infallibility”
as taught by Rousseau and Robespierre,
as well as by their present day disciples,
occurred in a certain county in Iowa, not fifty
miles from my home. A person charged with
second degree murder sought his constitutional
right of a fair and impartial trial. He made application
for a change of venue, alleging that his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
case had been prejudged and that because of
the existing prejudice he could not obtain a fair
trial within that county. Five citizens, the minimum
requisite number, supported his motion by
their affidavits. Promptly, two hundred most
reputable citizens filed counter affidavits alleging
that there was no prejudice whatever. The
judge believed the five. It is probable that he
discerned evidence of prejudice in the eagerness
with which the two hundred sought to have the
case tried in their midst. A change of venue was
granted, and that night these two hundred
liberty-loving citizens decided they would “no
longer have the governing power exercised by
judges on the bench,” broke open the jail, hung
the accused and would have done violence to the
judge if he had not been spirited away.</p>

<p class='c009' >If you want the opposite view of “popular infallibility,”
so you may the better determine for
yourself, listen to Colonel Henry Watterson, a
democrat of the old school and an American
always, in the <i>Brooklyn Eagle</i> of February 1,
1919:</p>

<p class='c009' >“The people,” says Colonel Watterson, “<i>en
masse</i> constitute what we call the mob. Mobs
have rarely been right—never, except when
capably led. It was the mob of Jerusalem that
did the unoffending Jesus of Nazareth to death.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
It was the mob in Paris that made the Reign of
Terror. From that day to this, mobs have seldom
been tempted, even had a chance to go wrong,
that they have not gone wrong. ‘The people’ is
a fetish. It was the people misled, who precipitated
the South into the madness of secession
and the ruin of a hopelessly unequal war of sections.
It was the people, backing if not compelling,
the Kaiser, who committed hari-kari for
themselves and their empire in Germany. It is
the people, leaderless, who are now making havoc
in Russia. Throughout the length and breadth
of Christendom in all lands and ages, the people,
when turned loose, have raised every inch of hell
to the square inch they were able to raise, often
upon the slightest pretext, or no pretext at all.”</p>

<div class='c018'>OFFICIAL TIMIDITY AND ITS EFFECTS</div>

<p class='c009' >In some, perhaps most of the states, candidates
for either House of Congress, knowing in advance
that if, by investigation and by listening
to arguments pro and con, they arrive at conclusions
based on knowledge that differ from the
impressions of their constituents based on prejudice,
they will never be returned, make more or
less formal announcement that, if elected, they
will study no question but, when ready to vote,
will inquire of those who have had neither opportunity
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span>
nor desire to inform themselves, and vote
as directed. We pay congressmen and senators
of this type—just the same as statesmanlike
representatives—seven thousand, five hundred
dollars a year, and they vote as they are told to
vote. If I am correctly informed, in some states
men have been found who will vote as they are
instructed for considerably less money even than
that.</p>

<p class='c009' >While the bill was pending to declare war
against Germany, I called upon a Congressman
who, without question, is the ablest man from his
state. He had written to lawyers, bankers,
farmers and labor men in his district, asking how
he should vote on that momentous question. He
handed me a package of replies he had received.
I returned them and asked: “Do you agree with
the President that Germany is already making
war upon the United States?” “Yes,” he replied,
“she has waged war against us for more than
two years.” “Do you think your constituents
know better than you what should be done?” His
up-to-date reply was: “My constituents know
nothing whatever about it, but I want to be re-elected.”</p>

<p class='c009' >But not every congressman is that subservient.
A certain well-known representative of a
strongly German district in Ohio explained his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
support of the declaration of war in this language:</p>

<p class='c009' >“If I were to permit any solicitude for my
political future to govern my action, I might
hesitate, but, gentlemen of the House, the only
interest to which I give heed tonight is the interest
of the American people; the only future to
which I look is the future of my country.”</p>

<p class='c009' >A few years ago a bill was pending to revise
the tariff and a member of Congress from a certain
industrial district arose and informed the
House that he had written to several labor men
in his district and asked them how he should vote
and that he had received a telegram saying,
“Vote for the bill.” He obeyed. This member
did not profess to vote his convictions. In fact,
he did not claim to be troubled with convictions.
And I submit that if a man is to vote the sentiment
of his district, rather than his judgment,
it is foolish to waste the time of men of judgment
by sending them to Congress. It would be more
appropriate and in far better taste to send men
who have nothing else to do. A thousand dollars
a year ought to be enough for a man who
bears no responsibility except to listen well,
especially if he be of a caliber willing to act as a
“rubber stamp” for the people at home.</p>

<p class='c009' >Right here I want to venture an opinion, asking
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
no one to agree with me: The gravest danger
that confronts the United States of America,
or that has confronted her in the last decade, has
not been the armed forces against which we sent
our brave boys in khaki, but in the fact that there
are hundreds of representatives, and thousands
of ambitious politicians, who cannot be purchased
with the wealth of Croesus, but who will vote for
anything and everything if by so doing they can
advance their political fortunes.</p>

<p class='c009' >Bolshevism would be crushed and the red flag
of anarchy would be no longer flaunted in the
face of Freedom, were it not for this timidity
inspired by those who insist that their representatives
shall have no discretion and no responsibility
except as clerks for an irresponsible populace.
This is the doctrine taught in Rousseau’s “Social
Contract,” which Robespierre read every day
and which furnished the inspiration for the
French Revolution. His scheme was “pure
democracy, unchecked, unlimited and undefiled
by political leadership or political organization.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Marat declared: “In a well regulated government
the people as a body is the real sovereign;
their deputies are appointed solely to
execute their orders. What right has the clay
to oppose the potter?” Again, he says: “It is
a sacred right of constituents to dismiss their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
representatives at will.” And again: “Reduce
the number of deputies” (corresponding to our
members of Congress) “to fifty; do not let them
remain in office more than five or six weeks; compel
them to transact their business during that
time in public.”</p>

<p class='c009' >This spirit of “pure democracy” which Washington,
with prophetic eye, saw and warned
against, wrought its natural and legitimate ruin
in France, is responsible for conditions now existing
in Russia and affords the greatest menace
to civilization that the world has ever seen. I do
not consider Washington a pessimist when, near
the close of his “Farewell Address” with heart
full of apprehension, he uttered these words:</p>

<p class='c009' >“In offering to you, my countrymen, these
counsels of an old and affectionate friend, I
dare not hope they will make the strong and
lasting impression I could wish; that they will
control the usual current of the passions, or prevent
our nation from running the course which
hitherto has marked the destiny of nations.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Someone has declared life to be “one succession
of choices.” The choice presented today is:
Heed the warnings and return to the teachings
of Washington; or go with Rousseau and
Robespierre and enter the port towards which
we are unmistakably headed—the port where
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
lie the rotting timbers of all previous republics.
Representative government and direct government
are inherently incompatible. They are
absolutely antagonistic.</p>

  <h2 id='chIX' class='c019'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />PRELIMINARY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>The basis of human happiness most be understood
before one can judge if the policy which our
government has pursued is calculated to afford
liberty in the pursuit of happiness—admittedly
the most important of our inalienable rights—as
well as to determine whether the same should be
reversed.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >Preliminary to the discussion of the original
design of government, and its gradual reversal
of purpose, I want to present as briefly as I may,
some philosophies of life. This I deem important,
for only as we understand the basis of
human happiness can we appreciate the wisdom
of the course which the United States pursued for
more than one hundred years, during which it
attained the proudest position ever occupied by
any nation.</p>

<p class='c009' >It is recorded that when the first parents were
being expelled from the Garden of Eden God
pronounced this blessing upon the race: “In the
sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.” I have
heard this referred to as a curse, but the All-wise
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
Father has never cursed the race. God seems to
be an individualist and not a collectivist. “Whosoever
will,” “The soul that sinneth it shall die,”
and many similar passages are as far removed
from socialistic teachings as is possible. They
are the exact opposite. After some years of experience
and much observation, I feel justified
in saying that, barring the promise of redemption,
the greatest blessing God Almighty ever pronounced
upon the race of man was when he said:
“In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Then God promulgated a great commandment
containing two injunctions, the first of which the
church seeks to enforce. It reads: “Remember
the Sabbath day to keep it holy.” The second,
equally important and as woefully transgressed,
says: “Six days shalt thou labor.” I know
people who violate each of these injunctions.
They break the Sabbath and will not work the
other six days.</p>

<p class='c009' >We also read that when God had made the
worlds and swung them into space, he pronounced
them “Very good.” It is but reasonable to believe,
and certainly reverent to say, that the Great
Jehovah got divine satisfaction and gratification
from his creatorship, and his sovereignty. When,
in the fullness of time, He made man in His own
image, wanting to provide for man’s happiness,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
He harked back to the thrill of creatorship and
gave man the capacity for the maximum of happiness
from his creatorships, his sovereignties, his
achievements.</p>

<p class='c009' >One needs but little observation to recognize
that achievement is the basis of man’s material
happiness. How often we hear men say: “This
was raw prairie. I made this farm.” “I planted
this grove.” “I started this store.” “I established
this bank.” “I built this factory.” I remember
very well Sir Thomas Lipton telling me
where, as an immigrant with but fifty cents in
his pocket, he spent his first night in New York
City. There is something more than a joke in
the statement that “self-made men are apt to be
proud of the job.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Nothing will develop manhood in a boy like
giving him a pig, a calf, a lamb or even a rabbit.
My! how a boy will grow in self-respect when
permitted just to call a colt “his,” and to feel the
resultant sense of proprietorship. The establishment
of gardens for boys, and the offering
of prizes for the best acre of corn grown by a
boy, is the best “uplift work” that was ever attempted.
Until very recent years the public has
never sought to apply these principles of mental
philosophy to the development of manly character
in the young.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
As soon as the savage feels this divinely implanted
impulse for ownership and achievement,
he is on the road towards civilization. Then, as
he advances, “individualism” becomes more
marked and instead of living in a hut, wearing
braided grass and eating his meat and fish raw,
he improves his condition and inequality begins.
Is civilization a failure? It must be if socialism
has any place in divine economy.</p>

  <h2 id='chX' class='c019'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />NO COMPETITION BETWEEN THE SEXES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>A brief discussion of the distinction between
women as voters and as statesmen.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >While this chapter is parenthetical and is not
essential to the argument, yet a discussion of the
philosophy of human happiness would be incomplete
without it.</p>

<p class='c009' >If man had the power of creation his present
wisdom would cause him not only to omit competition
between the sexes, but he would avoid
the possibility of even rivalry. The Creator in
His wisdom did not put the sexes in competition
and man can neither improve nor amend.</p>

<p class='c009' >Occasionally a woman develops a beard, but it
is so rare that she usually enters a museum.
Many years ago I saw a woman with a well-defined
“Adam’s apple.” But none of us admire
either “mannish” women or “sissy” men.</p>

<p class='c009' >Woman does not get her happiness from her
creatorships or sovereignties. The normal woman
prefers that her husband be the sovereign, and she
his queen. Woman gets her happiness from her
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
sacrifices. She gives herself to husband, to children,
to home, to church, to hospital, to good
deeds, and out of these sacrifices she gets the
maximum of her happiness. A boy asked the
butcher for tough meat and gave this reason: “If
I get tender meat, dad’ll eat it all.” That would
be a libel upon woman. We have each seen a
thousand times where mother was getting more
happiness in picking the neck and the back than
the children in eating the white meat, while dad
grabbed both upper joints.</p>

<p class='c009' >But there is another side to this. When dad
is refreshed, when his blood is red, when he is a
full-grown normal man, what does dad do? He
bears all the hardships and all the dangers this
world holds in store; he freezes in the arctics, he
melts in the tropics, that he may bring to those he
loves the choicest of earth, and adorn his queen
with the brightest jewels that glitter.</p>

<p class='c009' >I have never supposed that when our early ancestors
were confronted with danger that there
was any controversy as to who should defend the
other. I have assumed that she as instinctively
sprang to his left, as he to her right, that <i>his</i> sword
arm might be free. His name was John. Her
name was Mary. His brother’s name was Peter;
he married Margaret. Each pair named their
son Ole. There being two Oles in the tribe, a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
distinguishing name was necessary. Do you suppose
there was a family controversy to determine
whether one should be called “Ole Johnson” or
“Ole Maryson”?</p>

<p class='c009' >No, woman does not wish to be the head of a
clan, or to create or to possess, but she does desire
that her husband shall be a chieftain, a builder
and a landlord, and is willing to make any sacrifice
to that end. Woman wants to be loved and,
incidentally, let me say, needs to be told that
she is, in the tenderest way, and more than once.
If told sufficiently often, she is even proud to be
a slave to the man who loves her and sometimes is
without ever receiving a single post-nuptial word
of endearment.</p>

<p class='c009' >I doubt if anyone would favor woman’s suffrage
if he thought it would result in changing
woman’s nature, or in making her masculine in
manner. “Man’s chiefest inspiration to well-doing
is hope of companionship with that sacred,
true and well-embodied soul—a woman”—only
because an All-wise Creator made the sexes as
unlike as possible and still keep them both human.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c023'   >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For woman is not undeveloped man,</div>
      <div class='line'>But diverse. Could we but make her as the man,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sweet love were slain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009' >Only one woman has occupied a seat in Congress
and I am glad to record that she remained
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
womanly, and the other members manly. In that
respect the experiment was harmless. She was
permitted to violate the rules and to interrupt a
rollcall to explain her vote. Neither the Speaker
nor the members called her to order. Perhaps
they would have done so had she not been crying
at the time. During a speech criticising the enforcement
of law against a certain element in her
state, she was asked several questions which, together
with her answers, were taken down by the
official stenographer. When she revised the extension
of the notes for the Congressional Record,
she again violated the rules and struck out the
questions and answers and explained her conduct
by saying: “I didn’t want them in there.” The
congressmen affected, still chivalrous, did not
even ask to have the Record corrected.</p>

<p class='c009' >It will probably be some years before another
woman occupies a seat in either house, for statesmanship
is not gauged by intelligence or purity
of motive, so much as by aptitude crossed on
experience. Aptitude for the law, aptitude for
mechanics and aptitude for statecraft, are quite
rare, even among men. Many women have been
admitted to the bar, and while a few have had
some practice as attorneys, thus far the sex has
developed no one of marked legal ability. If it
should produce a lawyer or a master mechanic
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>
or a statesman, it will not necessarily entitle the
unfortunate to a place in a museum, but it will
be about as rare as anything in a museum.</p>

  <h2 id='chXI' class='c019'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />PURPOSES AND POLICIES OF GOVERNMENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>In this chapter the wisdom of the Fathers is
sought to be shown by the fact that they inaugurated
policies and purposes admirably calculated
to develop the individuality of each citizen, and
to afford the greatest opportunity for the maximum
of human happiness.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >With these philosophies of human life in our
mind, let us pass to the study of the purpose and
policy of our government as shown in its history.</p>

<p class='c009' >Imagine, if you will, that we have just won
our independence, that the Constitutional Convention
has been held, the matchless document
there formulated has been adopted and that the
United States of America has become a Nation.
Then suppose all the people within our domain
gather to determine the purpose and policy of
their government. Will we choose the least possible
government, and the greatest measure of
liberty, or shall the United States become a great
business concern with all its citizens on the payroll?
Shall government guard the liberties of
the people while they prosecute their business,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
or shall the government conduct the business and
the citizen guard the government?</p>

<p class='c009' >Alexander Hamilton will attend this meeting
and will make the speech of his life. Talleyrand
declared Hamilton’s to be the greatest intellect
he ever met. In addition to well-nigh matchless
mentality he probably possessed greater
vision than any man of his time; and vision is the
natural parent of statesmanship, if indeed it be
not statesmanship itself.</p>

<p class='c009' >Standing at the cradle of this nation, Alexander
Hamilton assures Talleyrand that either
Philadelphia or New York will be ultimately
the financial center of the world. Back in the
interior he predicts another metropolis. Eventually,
he declares, the United States will extend
to the Pacific Ocean and yonder on the
western coast there will be another metropolis.
If we build to such dimensions these must be
our policies.</p>

<p class='c009' >He continues his speech and tells us that the
United States is not only destined to be the most
powerful but likewise the richest nation in the
world. Our unearned increment will exceed the
dream of man. These lands, now worthless, are
intrinsically of great value. All the minerals and
all the metals will be found within our borders
and these will measure untold riches. Today we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>
have resources unequalled in any land, and resourcefulness
unmatched by any people, and he
reminds us that resourcefulness, when applied to
resources, will produce greatness.</p>

<p class='c009' >Then someone in the audience rises and announces
himself a bolshevist and moves that the
United States retain title to all these wonderful
resources until they attain their maximum value.
He proposes that we tolerate no “land hogs” and
permit no one to exploit the resources of America
or make profit out of iron or coal or oil or even
a waterpower.</p>

<p class='c009' >Then a socialist declares this to be a concise
statement of his creed and seconds the motion.
Non-partisan leaguers from North Dakota, and
single-taxers from California, also favor it. An
anarchist joins to say that while his people are
opposed to any laws, yet if laws are to be made,
they should each prohibit something and none
should encourage anything. Then an I. W. W.
declares that this will suit him, provided he be
not required to work. But the proposition is lost.</p>

<p class='c009' >Then a preamble and resolution is offered to
this effect: “Whereas, the All-wise Creator has
decreed that man shall derive his greatest happiness
from his achievements, therefore, with faith
both in God and man and believing in America,
be it resolved, that we emblazon upon the sky
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>82</a></span>
where all the world shall see, the great announcement
that the Stars and Stripes shall forever
stand for Opportunity!” This is carried by acclamation
and amid applause.</p>

<p class='c009' >Then another moves that we give notice to
every citizen, and to every person who may desire
to become a citizen, that in the pursuit of guaranteed
happiness, each shall have guaranteed
liberty to look over our broad domain, select the
biggest thing he dare undertake and, if he makes
it win, it shall belong to him. This motion is
carried by a rising vote.</p>

<p class='c009' >Then a third man moves that in the development
of our resources, the government shall foster
everything, and father nothing. In his speech
supporting the motion, he suggests that if Mr.
Hamilton’s prediction concerning the ultimate
greatness of America proves true, men will engage
in commerce; they will build ships and they
will build them too large for our harbors. Then
the government, in fostering commerce, will
deepen and widen our waterways, but it will not
father commerce and take over the ships. It will
leave to the citizen the right to own the ship, to
fly his flag at its mast and to get the thrill that
will surely come from sailing the biggest ship
that cuts the waves of ocean. Achieve and be
happy! This motion is also adopted.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
After these hopeful and courageous souls have
thus formulated a progressive policy, a man announces
his fear that he does not possess the
necessary vision, and certainly not the requisite
courage to accomplish any great thing and, therefore,
intends to become a wage-earner, and asks
the assembled citizenship of America what they
propose to do for him. Being honest with ourselves
we are compelled to admit that we can
promise little for the present. We tell him
frankly that if he is simply seeking wages, he
might as well remain in the country of his
nativity. We assure him, however, that if he
can endure pioneer hardships until the lands
have value, until the mines are developed, until
means of transportation are afforded, until the
unearned increment begins to appear, we will
give him better wages than the world has ever
seen. Have we kept faith? Let us see.</p>

<div class='c018'>RELATIVE REWARDS OF CAPITAL AND LABOR</div>

<p class='c009' >As late as 1840 men worked twelve hours per
day for twenty-five cents, payable in cornmeal or
meat, for there was no money. I can remember
when fifty cents per day was a good wage. Then,
when property began to have value, we started
up the spiral stairway of more wage and more
wage and then more wage.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>84</a></span>
What effect did this have? The world took
notice and immigration increased as wages advanced.
In 1907 over one million immigrants
landed on our shores, and more than half with
less than the required $35.00 in cash. The next
year 800,000 went back. Some of them had been
here several years and others only a short time,
but, in addition to what they had sent home, they
took with them from three hundred to five thousand
dollars each.</p>

<p class='c009' >How about capital? For nearly one hundred
years, foreign capital sought American opportunity.
Foreign capital built our first railways,
established our first banks, erected our first factories.
But about twenty-five years ago it largely
ceased to come, for it could do no better here than
elsewhere. Even American capital sought employment
in Mexico, China and in Canada, simply
because these countries offered better rewards
for capital. The records of the Immigration Department
contain positive proof that for more
than twenty-five years labor in this country has
been relatively better rewarded than capital.
Otherwise capital would have come as labor came.</p>

<p class='c009' >This great truth ought not to be ignored. The
only reason capital continued to come for one
hundred years is because it could do better here
than elsewhere. The only reason that it ultimately
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
went elsewhere is because it could do better
elsewhere. Meantime, immigration, most of it
swelling the ranks of labor, increased solely because
labor received in America a relatively larger
share of the profits of business and enterprise than
in any other country on the map.</p>

<p class='c009' >No one claims that even now labor receives
more than its due. I am simply demonstrating
the <i>relative</i> rewards of capital and labor in the
United States and citing positive proof that
immigrants who come seeking opportunity do not
pursue a barren hope.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c019'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />THE RESULT OF THIS POLICY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>The policy defined in the preceding chapter is
illustrated and its wisdom shown by the logical
results thereof. The source and constant course
of wages is also discussed.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >After spending seventy-five years of our
national life in the discussion of state rights, and
then four years of bloody fratricidal war, the
fact that the United States of America is a
nation and not simply a confederation of sovereign
states was definitely determined. Occasionally,
we still hear people speak of “<i>these</i>
United States.” But there are none. This one
is all there is. The term “these United States”
comes dangerously near a treasonable utterance.
The court of last resort rendered its decree at
Appomattox that the United States of America
is “one and inseparable, now and forever.”</p>

<p class='c009' >After this perplexing question was settled, the
government proceeded to foster industry in the
largest possible way. For instance, certain men
proposed that, if properly encouraged, they would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>
construct a railroad to the Pacific coast. They
were reminded that only a few years before it
had been said that not even a wagon road could
be builded across the Rocky Mountains. “Yes,”
says General Dodge, “but we will build a railroad.”
They asked a subsidy of money, to be
returned as soon as possible, and one-half of a
twenty mile strip of land in perpetuity. They
were given both. The land was then worthless.
Do you realize that if the land that was given
to the Union Pacific Railroad on condition that
the road should be builded to the Pacific Ocean,
had been given to the Astors, on condition that
the Astors should go out and look at it each year,
it would have broken the Astors. There was no
way to go out to see it. In effect, the government
kept most of the land for homesteaders and
gave half of certain adjacent tracts to railroads
on condition that they make it worth while for
homesteaders to occupy the reserved portions.
What is the result? The Rocky Mountain Empire,
yielding all the minerals, all the metals,
lumber, fruits, vegetables, with millions of people
living in happy homes, and all because the government
fostered enterprise and said: “Achieve
and be happy.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Where there is incentive there will always
be achievement.</p>

<div class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION</div>

<p class='c009' >Permit one more illustration. One thousand
can be furnished as well as one. Certain men
proposed to the government that on certain conditions
they would build a silk mill. The government
exclaimed: “A silk mill in the United
States! We produce no raw silk.” This was
promptly acknowledged and likewise the higher
wages necessary to be paid in America. Still
they promised to build a silk mill if they were
permitted to buy their raw silk wherever they
could find it without paying anything to the government
for the privilege, and, provided further,
that foreigners who might bring manufactured
silk to this market, in competition with the product
of their mill, should be required to pay sixty
cents out of every dollar received, into the treasury
of the United States for the maintenance of
this government, and go home contented and
happy with forty cents. The government replied:
“Go build your mill. If you cannot live
on those terms, we will make the foreigner pay
sixty-five cents.” What is the result? Ninety
million dollars’ worth of raw silk is annually
imported and forty-five million dollars are paid
in wages to the workmen manufacturing it.
Achieve and be happy!</p>

<div class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>89</a></span>
WHAT BECOMES OF WAGES?</div>

<p class='c009' >What becomes of this forty-five million dollars
in wages annually paid by the silk mills of
America? Every dollar of it is spent. We all
spend all we get. We spend it for necessaries or
comforts or luxuries or taxes or foolishness, or
we expend it for a house, or a bond, or we deposit
it in a bank and someone else spends or expends it.</p>

<p class='c009' >Let us assume that this particular forty-five
million dollars of silk mill wages is paid to western
farmers for food. The western farmers send
it east for knit goods and shoes and these factories
pay it out again to labor and labor sends
it west again for food. How often will wages
make the circuit?</p>

<p class='c009' >A man earns, say, five dollars and spends it at
night for food and clothes. The merchant spends
his profit and pays the balance to the producer
of food and clothes. The producer keeps it as
a reward for his toil or pays it for wages. In
either event, it goes again for food and clothes.
William McKinley estimated that wages would
thus make the circuit and come back to the wage
earner ten times per annum. I believe the estimate
conservative. A million men annually earning
one thousand dollars each, makes one billion
dollars in wages. This billion dollars going to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>90</a></span>
the merchant ten times a year and back to labor
as often, makes an aggregate of ten billion dollars
in trade every twelve months.</p>

<div class='c018'>A SUMMARY OF ACHIEVEMENT</div>

<p class='c009' >Now, hold your breath. The figures showing
the material result of fifty years of applied common
sense, will stagger you.</p>

<p class='c009' >When the European war began, our farms
were producing more than the farms of any other
country on the map. Our mines yielded gold by
trainload annually, and we unloaded from coastwise
ships and railways on the soil of Ohio alone
more iron ore than any other country in the world
produced. In fifty years we had builded as many
miles of railroad as all the rest of the world, and
these roads, before the government began fixing
rates, were carrying our freight for one-third of
what was charged for like service elsewhere beneath
the sky. We cut from our forests one hundred
million feet of lumber for every day of the
calendar year, and annually pumped from the
earth beneath 250,000,000 barrels of petroleum,
over sixty-five percent of the world’s gross product.
Owing to the rapid exchange of wages for
necessaries and comforts and then again for
wages, our domestic trade had become five times
as large as the aggregate international commerce
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
of creation. Our shops and factories turned out
more finished products than all the shops and all
the factories of Great Britain and France and
Germany combined, plus five thousand million
dollars’ worth every twelve months, and we paid
out as much in wages as all the rest of the human
family. Achieve and be happy!</p>

<p class='c009' >I hope you will understand that I am not defending
either our form of government or our
policy. George Washington, Alexander Hamilton,
Benjamin Franklin and those other immortal
men, may have been blithering idiots
when they chose to create a republic instead of
a democracy. I only cite the fact that they did
create a republic. We <i>might</i> have accomplished
more had the government tilled the lands, built
the ships, constructed and operated the railroads,
erected the factories, opened the mines, transacted
the business and put everyone on the public
payroll. I only seek to make it clear that this
was not done and that we did fairly well, considering.</p>

<p class='c009' >During all this period, the government accepted
as its appropriate function the protection
of the citizen, while the citizen sought happiness
and secured it through achievement. The government
sought to protect him from murder, but
did not always succeed. It tried to shield him
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
from robbery, but sometimes failed. It aimed
to prevent extortion but was not always successful.
It did its best to see that opportunity should
knock once at every door, but did nothing to
force an entrance or insure a second call. Still,
notwithstanding errors, weaknesses and admitted
inefficiency, the American citizen has been
afforded better protection against all the evils
that assail mankind, than the people of any other
country and, in the pursuit of happiness, Americans
have enjoyed far wider liberty of action,
and an infinitely greater percent of realization.</p>

  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c019'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />ALL DEPENDENT UPON THE PAYROLL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>The importance of the American payroll upon
which all rely is emphasized, and the necessity
of safeguarding this payroll is shown together
with a lesson in domestic economy.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >While the government has kept as few as possible
in its employ we are dependent, directly
or indirectly, upon the payroll. Not only the
merchant and the farmer, but the professional
man and banker, have suffered when, for any
cause, labor has stood in the bread line. This is
well illustrated by the fact that the American
people consumed 5.94 bushels of wheat per capita
during 1892, only 3.44 bushels in 1894 and over
7 bushels in 1906. He who had eaten at the back
door as a tramp fed himself like a prince when
every wheel was turning and everyone working.</p>

<p class='c009' >These figures are also illuminating: We imported
for consumption $12.50 per capita in 1892,
only $10.81 in 1896 and $16.49 in 1907. This
may cause surprise when you remember that the
minimum per capita importation of 1896 was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
when the average tariff duty collected thereon
was only 20.67 percent, while in 1907 the average
rate was 23.28 percent. Notwithstanding
the higher rate, we actually imported for consumption
sixty percent more merchandise per
capita than under the lower tariff rate. No more
indubitable proof can be found that when labor
is employed, and the payroll large, all classes and
conditions prosper.</p>

<div class='c018'>ECONOMIC PHILOSOPHY</div>

<p class='c009' >Suppose I build a factory costing, say, one
hundred thousand dollars, and enter an untried
field of manufacture. I pay out two hundred
thousand dollars in wages and make a net profit
of fifty thousand dollars. These figures are
unimportant except as an illustration. I have
made fifty per cent on my investment and the
world says it is too much. It is too much, notwithstanding
the fact that I take all the risk,
make the experiment and demonstrate the possibilities
of a new industry. I also pay a wage
at which my employees are glad to work. Not
one of them risks a day’s toil. But, because my
profits are large, if for no other reason, I am
certain to have competition next year.</p>

<p class='c009' >What shall I do with my fifty thousand dollars
net profit? I can eat no more than I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
eaten, and I cannot wear more than one suit
of clothes at a time.</p>

<p class='c009' >I challenge anyone to tell me how I can keep
my profit away from labor except by converting
it into cash and locking it in a safe deposit
box. Suppose I give my daughter a big wedding
and spend much money for cut flowers.
Cut flowers are nature’s sunshine plus management
and labor. So management and labor get
that. But management is compelled to spend
its share as I spend mine, and thus it all goes
directly or indirectly to labor. I build for my
daughter a home and fill it with furniture, china,
glass and silver. Both the house and its furnishings
consist of lumber in the forest, ore in
the ground, clay in the pit, white sand in the
bank, and other raw materials, plus management,
labor and transportation—and transportation
is labor. Thus labor gets all except the
portion which goes to management and capital,
and management and capital are compelled to
turn their respective shares into labor.</p>

<p class='c009' >Here the theoretical socialist and the scientist—I
mean the man who recognizes that
nothing is scientific except what stands the
test of experience—part company. The socialist
admits that cut flowers are sunshine plus labor
and as sunshine receives no portion he demands
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
that labor shall have it all. He forgets or
refuses to recognize that without directing
energy there would be no greenhouse, water
system, heating plant or other essential of production.
Labor and sunshine never produced
anything better than a wild flower. Of course
labor may and frequently does furnish the management.
All the necessary equipment for the
production of the various articles I have mentioned
is the result of a directing genius which
we call management.</p>

<p class='c009' >Let no one accuse me of trying to deceive or
cajole labor. I not only admit, but I assert,
that there is far more satisfaction, though not
necessarily greater happiness, in drawing dividends
than wages. I have had both experiences.
I am an expert, for I have either touched or
seen life at every angle. I have worked to the
limit, day after day, from five in the morning
until nine at night for hire, with not to exceed
one hour for the three meals, and have gone to
bed happy. For fifteen years I was at my law
office, as a rule, from seven in the morning until
ten at night, and for more than thirty years of
my mature life I never took a day for recreation.
My wife and I are now living quite comfortably
from dividends, but we look back upon those
strenuous years, in which this best woman in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>97</a></span>
world joyfully and even joyously bore her
share, as the happiest period of our lives. Still
I repeat, dividends are better than pay envelopes
or checks from clients. And I am glad
they are. The All-Wise must have designed
they should be, for otherwise life would be one
dreary humdrum of drudgery, with little incentive
to great effort and greater sacrifice, the
universal <i>quid pro quo</i> in the great one-price
store of republics.</p>

<p class='c009' >In this connection permit me to urge every
man whose wakeful hours are spent in toil, to
make it exceedingly clear to his children that
there is more satisfaction in drawing dividends
than wages. Let the youth also know that
nearly every one who now draws dividends
began by drawing wages. I can recall very
few men whose names are or have been known
beyond the confines of local communities,
whether bankers, lawyers, manufacturers, merchants
or railroad presidents, whose hands have
not been calloused with humble toil. This is
conspicuously so of Rockefeller, Carnegie,
Wanamaker and Schwab, and was equally true
of E. H. Harriman, C. P. Huntington, J. J.
Hill, George M. Pullman, the McCormicks and
practically all others who in days past rendered
conspicuous service in making America.</p>

  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c019'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />AMERICAN FORTUNES NOT LARGE, CONSIDERING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>A country of such resources could not be developed
as America has been without great fortunes resulting.
Inequality of results in every field of
human endeavor, except the acquisition of property,
is welcomed and approved by everyone.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >I am not surprised at the fortunes that have
been made in this country. On the contrary,
even greater fortunes might have been reasonably
expected. As I look over the matchless
resources of America, the surface of which as
yet has been only scratched, and the matchless
resourcefulness of our people, I marvel that
even greater accumulations have not been made.
I have been frequently surprised that I did not
make more myself. But I can account for it,
so far as I am concerned. I heard of a man
who said he could write as good poetry as
Shakespeare, “if he had a mind to.” His friends
assured him he had discovered his handicap.
That was my difficulty. I had the disposition,
and I have had the opportunity. As I look
back over the years of my mature life I recognize
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
that I have failed to heed opportunities
where I might have made more money than any
man has made. But I did not have the vision;
I did not have the courage; I did not have the
“mind to.”</p>

<p class='c009' >I can construct a highway so the worst old
scrub of a horse, with his mane and tail full of
cockleburrs, can keep up with a thoroughbred.
Yes, I can. But the mud must needs be very
deep and quite thick. When the mud is sufficiently
heavy, one horse can keep up with another.
But when the track is improved, the
horse with aptitude for speed will soon distance
the old cockleburred scrub, who would, if he
could talk, very likely insist there is something
wrong with our civilization, and become a
socialist.</p>

<p class='c009' >We all demand good roads, though we all
know that if we have good roads we will have
to take someone’s dust. The only way, my
friend, to protect yourself from the other man’s
dust is to have the roads so bad he cannot pass
you.</p>

<div class='c018'>A PARABLE</div>

<p class='c009' >During the free silver campaign of 1896, a
man with a full unkempt beard and shaggy hair,
after several times interrupting the speaker, finally
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>100</a></span>
asked in squeaky voice: “Mr. Speaker, how
do you account for the unequal distribution of
wealth?” The answer came with promptness.
“How do you account for the unequal distribution
of whiskers?” When the audience had
quieted down, the speaker might have said:
“My friend, I did not make that remark to cause
merriment at your expense. I made it to illustrate
a great truth. I was born with equal
opportunity and equal aptitude for whiskers
with yourself. But I have dissipated mine.
Whenever I have found myself in possession
of any perceptible amount of whiskers, I have
dissipated them. Had I conserved my whiskers,
as you evidently have, I, too, would be a millionaire
in whiskers.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Tell your boys, and the boys you meet, that
if ever they become millionaires in dollars as
in whiskers, the chances are it will be because
they conserve. John J. Blair, the pioneer railroad
builder west of the Mississippi River, once
told Senator Allison that the wife of Commodore
Vanderbilt had many times cooked for him
a five o’clock breakfast, for which she charged
twenty cents. The seed from which all great
fortunes have been grown was hand picked.</p>

<p class='c009' >In the war between the states more than a
million men enlisted on either side, and at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>101</a></span>
end of four and one-half years there were fifty
or one hundred multi-millionaires in military
achievement and military glory and ten thousand
in unmarked graves. Socialists do not object
to these inequalities. While they seem to welcome
millionaires in art, in music, and in athletics
they all point to millionaires in business as an
unanswerable indictment of America’s political
system. They rejoice that it can produce an
Edison, but mourn that it can also produce a
Rockefeller. Yet the success of these two wizards
is traceable alike to extraordinary aptitude
in their respective fields of achievement, plus
extraordinary application. Neither of these men
ever robbed me of a penny. On the contrary
each has contributed to my comfort, thus adding
to the worth of living, and each has cheapened
for me the cost of high living. But for Mr.
Edison, or someone of a different name to do
what he has done, I would be deprived of electric
light and many other comforts. But for
Mr. Rockefeller, or some one of a different name
to do what Mr. Rockefeller has done, every
owner of an oil well would be pumping his
product into barrels in the olden way, hauling
it to town and selling on a manipulated market,
while I would be deprived of a hundred by-products
of petroleum, be still paying twenty-five
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
cents per gallon for poor kerosene, and there
would be no such thing known in all the world
as gasoline.</p>

  <h2 id='chXV' class='c019'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />POPULAR DISSATISFACTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>It is as logical that dissatisfaction should develop
because of inequality of results in “money making,”
as it is that inequality in results shall follow
inequality of aptitude and effort. This dissatisfaction
has tended strongly to develop
socialistic thought and teaching.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >A century and a quarter, during which representatives
were chosen because of actual or
supposed aptitude, and retained in office during
long periods—frequently for life—when nearly
every industry was fostered, and none fathered,
developed a people, the best paid, the best fed,
the best clothed, the best housed, the best educated,
enjoying more of the comforts of life, far
more of its luxuries, enduring less hardships
and privations, than any other in all history;
but it is an even guess if, at the same time, we
did not become more restless, discontented and
unhappy.</p>

<p class='c009' >We were not so much dissatisfied, however,
with our own condition, abstractly considered,
as with our relative condition. The man with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span>
rubber heels would have thought himself favored
had he not seen someone with a bicycle, and the
man with a bicycle was contented until his friend
got a motorcycle. The man with a motorcycle
thought he had the best the world afforded until
he saw an automobile and the man in the automobile
was happy until his neighbor got a yacht.
“All this availeth me nothing so long as I see
Mordecai, the Jew, sitting at the king’s gate.”</p>

<p class='c009' >I have lived some years in this blessed land
and the only criticism I have ever heard, either
of our form of government or our policy, is the
fact that some men have got rich.</p>

<p class='c009' >I made this statement in a public speech some
months ago and asked who had heard any other.
A man answered: “Some people have got poor.”
I admitted that I had known a number of fellows
whose fathers had left them money and
who had got poor, but I told the audience that
most of the poor men whom I had known had
simply remained poor. I asked my critic if he
had ever fattened cattle. He admitted he had
not. Then I assured him that he would seldom
see a steer getting poor in a feed yard where
others were doing well and most were getting
fat, but he would frequently see one that remained
poor, notwithstanding his environments.</p>

<p class='c009' >Two men were standing by the side of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
New York Central Railroad. One said to the
other: “My, see this track of empire! Four
tracks, great Mogul engines taking two thousand
tons of freight at a load, passenger trains
making sixty miles an hour. There comes the
express!” As the train passed a cinder lit in
the eye of the enthusiast, when immediately he
denounced the road, cursed the management and
swore at all four tracks.</p>

<p class='c009' >In a country like ours, where conditions have
been superb, resources matchless and resourcefulness
unequalled, none should be surprised at
the speed we have developed and no one ought
to use language unfit to print simply because
there are cinders in the air. Admittedly there
are. We have all had them in our eyes. They
are more than annoying, but the only way to
prevent cinders is to tear up the tracks. And
it is simply surprising the number of good people
who are trying to make the world a paradise
through a policy of destruction.</p>

<p class='c009' >Socialists, near-socialists, bolsheviki, anarchists,
I. W. W.’s, non-partisan leaguers, single
taxers, and all the infernal bunch of disturbers
and propagandists of class hatred, unintentionally
led and reinforced by a large percent of
the teachers of political economy and sociology
in our colleges and universities, seem bent upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
nothing less than a revolution in both our form
of government and our policy of government.
Unless something be speedily done to counteract
there surely will be precipitated in America what
France experienced, and what Russia is now
suffering.</p>

<div class='c018'>WHILE STATESMEN SLEEP THE EVIL ONE SOWS TARES</div>

<p class='c009' >In the winter of 1898 I attended a much
advertised lecture by George D. Herron, then
Professor of Applied Christianity in one of the
largest colleges west of the Mississippi. The
lecture was given in the largest church of Des
Moines, on a Sunday evening, and most of the
other churches adjourned their services that they
might hear this “remarkable man.” Several of
the leading pastors occupied the pulpit with him
and the pastor of the second largest church in the
city introduced the lecturer, I remember, as “a
Man with a Mission.” He spoke at length and
his utterances were applauded by a good percent
of the congregation, and by several of the
pastors. Of course the vile life he was living,
and the viler social belief which he then and now
entertains, were unknown, but his far more dangerous
teachings were well known to all and
approved by many. The burden of his “mission”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>107</a></span>
was denunciation of what he called the
“Divine Right of Property,” which he compared
to the “Divine Right of Kings” and predicted
that as the latter had been overthrown by revolution,
the former must be. It was indeed a
“theory pickled in the preserving juices of pulpit
eloquence and laid by against a day of reckoning.”
I speak of this not to criticise the good
people who approved his utterances, many of
whom did not comprehend what was involved,
but to show the prevalence of bolshevist teachings
twenty years ago. Unless he has changed
he should prove very satisfactory to the bolshevists
of Russia, where at this writing he is supposed
to be at the request of the President.</p>

<p class='c009' >Quite recently the professor of political economy
in one of the state universities of the Middle
West, in the course of his daily denunciations
of the policy of internal improvement as pursued
by this government, and his condemnations
of wealth and the possessors thereof, referred
to the grant of land to the Northern Pacific
Railroad and characterized it as a “gigantic
steal.” A member of his class who had had
rare privileges interrupted to ask: “If the lands
in this grant were so valuable how do you explain
the fact that Jay Cooke, after financing
the Civil War, went broke in selling Northern
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>108</a></span>
Pacific Railroad Bonds, secured by both the
road and the lands, at 85 per cent of par?” The
professor inquired where the young man had
obtained his information and was told: “From
the memoirs of Jay Cooke.” “Well,” said the
professor, “that is a subject to be considered.”
But the next day he continued sowing seeds of
anarchy.</p>

<p class='c009' >During the winter of 1916 I listened to a
lecture by a man of international reputation
before the students of one of our very large
eastern universities. Early in his tirade, improperly
called lecture, he informed the students
that there were two ways to make money—“one
to earn it and the other to steal it.” He told
them that when they worked on the street railway
they earned their money, but when the
company charged five cents for a ride, it stole
its money. The students applauded. Later he
told them that if they wanted to go to Boston
over the New Haven Railroad, and all the workmen
should die or strike, they would get no
farther than they could walk; but if all the
stockholders and bond owners were to die, they
“might thank God for the dispensation but they
would get to Boston just the same.” The students
applauded. He closed in this language:
“They talk about preparedness, and well they
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>109</a></span>
may, for if these conditions continue, preparedness
will be necessary against the internal uprising
that is certain to follow.” The students
again applauded.</p>

<p class='c009' >If there has been any systematic effort made
to suppress, nullify or destroy bolshevistic
teachings, not always as bold but of the same
character, with which nearly every college and
university is daily deluged, both from chair and
rostrum, I will be glad to know when and where
the counteracting forces have been applied.
Many men of wealth have thought they were
advancing the interest of their country and
humanity generally by endowing colleges and
universities. We have made education a fetich
and have assumed that all education is alike
good. It would be far better for America to
have its youth poisoned with strychnine than
with bolshevism. Poison administered through
the stomach is not contagious, but what has been
lodged in the brain at these hotbeds of socialism
spreads, and when it breaks in epidemic no army
can effect a quarantine.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>The government very properly interfered to
curb aggression and extortion. That is a most
appropriate function of government, but a very
inappropriate end and can be carried too far.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >Just cause for complaint did, does and always
will exist. The Kingdom of Heaven has not
yet been established by human agencies. Greed
of gain, whetted by indulgence, led to practices
in many instances reprehensible. Some of the
big fellows who had achieved great things, and
rightfully owned what they had accomplished,
seemed to think they also owned the little things
that others had done. Punishment became necessary
and the government administered it wisely
and with lavish hand. Not a few of the big boys
were whipped in the presence of the infant class,
a thing always gratifying to juniors. Thereupon,
all the little people became hilarious over
these just punishments and it became a pastime
to get after “those higher up.” One of our distinguished
senators is credited with the statement
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>
that the people changed the motto over
their Temples of Justice to “Soak Him.” It
soon became more difficult to secure the acquittal
of an innocent man of affairs, than it had been
to convict the guilty. Until time is no more the
pendulum will continue to swing from one extreme
to another.</p>

<div class='c018'>PUNISHMENT A MEANS, NOT AN END</div>

<p class='c009' >I know of no better illustration of the necessity
of punishment and the desirability of quitting
when its purpose is accomplished than an
incident told me by a man who claimed to have
been an eye-witness.</p>

<p class='c009' >Back in the days when young men attended
school until they were married, a theological
student attempted to teach in a country district
on the frontier of Ohio. The big boys became
obstreperous. He urged them to treat him respectfully
for he said he was studying for the
ministry. The effect was as one might suppose.
They carried him out, they washed his face in
the snow, they dipped him in the creek until he
gave up in despair.</p>

<p class='c009' >Shortly thereafter, another youth applied.
The director told him he could not maintain
discipline. He said if he failed, it would cost
the district nothing. Certificates to teach were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span>
then unknown. When the pupils assembled,
they found him sitting at his desk reading.
They looked him over, sized him up, thought
him an easy mark and commenced pounding
their desks and stamping their feet, and kept
it up until nine o’clock. Then the new teacher
laid aside his book, locked the door, put the key
in his pocket and called school to order. The
preliminaries having been unusual, silence was
secured. He informed them they need not attempt
to escape, for the windows were nailed
down. Then, opening his carpet bag, he brought
forth a revolver, a bowie knife and a blacksnake
whip. Then after warning the pupils not to
arise until their names were called, he summoned
John Jones to the floor. With whip in one hand
and revolver in the other, he proceeded to give
private lessons. When through with John he
called Bill Smith. He did not need to ask their
names. After going some distance down his list,
he told them they had probably learned more
that day than they had ever learned in any one
day in their lives, and perhaps as much as it was
wise to attempt to learn in one day, adding:
“When you come again, come expecting to obey
the rules, attend to business and make no false
motions. There will be no further exercises today.”
They never knew whence he came nor
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span>
where he went. He had performed his mission
and wisely left future tasks to his successor.</p>

<p class='c009' >I did not inquire concerning the subsequent
history of that school, but I understand human
nature enough to know that if his successors
were men without plan or purpose or policy of
their own, and only sought to repeat the popular
practices of their predecessor, they permanently
ruined that school. There was but one wise
course. Without apologizing for what had been
done, or lowering the standard of discipline,
there should have been a return to the ordinary
tasks of the schoolroom without unnecessary delay,
for I declare to you that corporal punishment
is not the purpose for which schools are
established, nor are criminal prosecutions the aim
and end for which governments are instituted
among men. Both are essential at times, but let
us hope that captains of industry and business
men generally have learned their lesson sufficiently
so that it shall not be necessary to continue
indefinitely what was so admirably done a
decade or more ago.</p>

<p class='c009' >Unless punishment is discriminately administered,
demoralization will follow, and if the big
boys are whipped for no other purpose than to
please the little folks, they will probably go fishing.
And whenever the big boys of America
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
take a day off, trouble ensues. Only a very few
years ago, I saw a thousand men standing in
line awaiting their turn for a cup of coffee and
a slice of bread at the hands of charity. Business
simply could not stand the lash incessantly
applied. It had taken a day off.</p>

<p class='c009' >Then the war came, abnormal demands were
created and great prosperity ensued. But before
the revival of industry, sufficient time
elapsed to permit a fundamental economic principle
to be elucidated in the greatest school of
the world, the school of experience.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>While supervision and control of big business is
essential, the trend has been in the direction of
interference and in many instances inhibition.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >While both political parties, and all administrations,
profess great friendship for business,
the treatment that both political parties have
accorded business is well illustrated by the fable
of the elephant that, in going through the
jungle, stepped on a mother bird. When the
elephant saw the havoc she had wrought, she
called the orphaned chick and said: “This is
deplorable. I did not intend to kill your mother.
I am a mother myself and have the mother
instinct. But the deed has been done and is
past recall. Being unable to restore your mother
I shall give my efforts to the task that your
mother would perform if she were living.” So
the elephant sat down on the chicks.</p>

<p class='c009' >The American people have shown great aptitude
and achieved unparalleled success in two
distinct fields—baseball and business. During
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>
the period of development and successful prosecution
of these two great national games, the
rules of the game were made by experts in the
respective games. Practical bankers made the
rules of banking, experienced traffic men made
rules governing transportation, and expert baseball
players formulated the rules of that game.
Business has suffered because of modern methods,
and baseball will go where business had
gone prior to the war, should the same policy
be pursued and the committee that is to make
the rules of baseball be selected under the direct
primary system, from among those who never
play the game, and seldom see it played, upon
a platform demanding that strenuous playing
shall cease, and that the score must be a tie
regardless of errors.</p>

<p class='c009' >Instead of permitting practical bankers to
apply fundamental banking principles, we have
forty-nine distinct sets of statutory rules, one
for each state and one for the union of states,
enacted by men some of whom have no more
knowledge of banking than they have of aeronautics,
and frequently administered by those
whose tenure of office depends upon the amount
of trouble they can make.</p>

<p class='c009' >We legislate to prevent monopolies and for
the ostensible purpose of encouraging competition,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span>
but the rules of banking are well nigh prohibitive
of the creation of new competitive concerns.
The president of one of the largest banking
institutions in the United States, whose operations
extend into every state, told me that
he had refused a loan to Phil Armour except
upon collateral that could be sold on the stock
exchange of any city, and in the same conversation
said there was not a loan in his institution
except upon listed collateral. Only big concerns
can furnish that class of security.</p>

<p class='c009' >Suppose you were to build a packing house
costing one million dollars and should make a
bond issue of five hundred thousand dollars so
as to have collateral. The officers of no bank
would care to lend on those bonds. To do so
would be to rely upon their judgment, and some
little bank examiner would report that the bank
had loaned on collateral that had no market
value. Thereupon the Banking Department
would write criticising the loan and directing
that the letter be read to the board and a certain
number of directors sign a reply. The
course of least resistance is to refuse all loans
except to monopolies or upon stock exchange
collateral.</p>

<p class='c009' >Not long ago a friend applied to one of the
large banking institutions in New York City
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>118</a></span>
for a loan upon unlisted securities. The president
took from his desk a certificate of stock of
a certain railroad and said: “I do not believe
this stock worth the paper it is printed on, but
I will lend money upon it. I believe your securities
are absolutely good but I will not lend a
dollar upon them.”</p>

<p class='c009' >The reason was sensible, and the banker was
wise when banking laws and the rules of banking
departments are considered. The railroad
stock was listed and dealt in every hour. Hence
the public assumed it had value, and it could be
sold on the stock exchange for a price that fluctuated
little. Its intrinsic value, if any, was
problematic, but it did have a market value.
The security offered was not listed. In the
opinion of the banker it had abundant intrinsic
value, but since it did not have a market value
on the stock exchange, he did not feel justified
in inviting criticism from the Banking Department
by relying upon his judgment. It is difficult
for a new concern to get credit and without
credit no concern can live.</p>

<div class='c018'>BECAUSE ONE HORSE KICKS SHALL WE HAMSTRING THE WHOLE DROVE?</div>

<p class='c009' >To a greater or less degree, the same policy
has been applied to nearly all important branches
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'>119</a></span>
of business. The rules for the operation of
railroads and insurance companies are both complex
and conflicting. The books have to be kept
to conform to the legislative requirements of
every state in which the concern does business.</p>

<p class='c009' >A certain express company formerly employed
one attorney at two thousand dollars a year. It
now maintains a legal department occupying an
entire floor of an office building, and the officers
of the company are in daily consultation lest
they violate some state or federal statute and go
to the penitentiary.</p>

<p class='c009' >The president of an insurance company told
me that if he did in Missouri what he was required
to do in Texas, the penitentiary would
await him, while if he omitted it in Texas, his
punishment would be equally modest.</p>

<p class='c009' >Severity of punishment in the United States
has not yet reached the limit witnessed in France
late in the eighteenth century when direct
government was carried to its logical extreme.
At that time the death penalty was prescribed
for those who took food products out of circulation
and kept them stored without daily and
publicly offering them for sale. Failing to
make a true declaration of the amount of goods
on hand for eight days, and retaining a larger
stock of bread than was necessary for daily
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span>
wants, were punishable by death. Death also
awaited the farmer who did not market his grain
weekly and the merchant who failed to keep his
shop open for business. We may or may not go
to this extreme in America. I do not at the
moment recall any punishment at the present
time in this country more severe than six months
in jail and a fine of five hundred dollars for
spitting on the sidewalk.</p>

  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c019'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />THE INEVITABLE RESULT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>As soon as the government changed its policy and
denied exceptional rewards for exceptional risks
virile Americans refused to assume these risks
and internal improvements ceased. A distinction
is drawn between pioneer capital and improvement
capital.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >The effect of this changed attitude toward
internal improvement and business generally is
exactly what every thoughtful person foresaw.
No railroad construction worth mentioning has
been begun in the last decade. A few unimportant
extensions have been made. About five
years ago, John D. Spreckels attempted the
construction of a road from San Diego to the
Imperial Valley, but a possible six percent return,
if it proved a success, and total loss if it
failed, did not prove inviting to capital. Facing
disaster, he turned it over to one of the old established
lines to be builded on the accumulated
credit of that system.</p>

<p class='c009' >The United States was never in such great
need of additional transportation as during the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
last ten years and never before was so little done
to supply it. James J. Hill, the great empire
builder of the Northwest, used to furnish figures
to prove that we must invest two billion dollars
new capital per annum to keep pace with the
development of the country. It did not require
a sage or a seer to discern that if we multiplied
production from farm and factory, mill and
mine, indefinitely, and failed to provide transportation
facilities, we would ultimately reach
a time when crops would rot on the ground
while those who had grown them would be freezing
and coal miners starving. Truly, the American
people are “kin-folks.”</p>

<p class='c009' >For more than three years, liberty hung in
the balance simply because the United States,
with all her development, had failed to keep her
transportation facilities abreast of her production.</p>

<p class='c009' >We had no merchant marine and during the
entire period of the war were dependent largely
upon the Allies to transport our troops and
our munitions. Adverse marine laws had been
passed rendering it impossible to sail an American
ship in deep sea transportation except at
great loss even if the ship had cost nothing
whatever. It became necessary for the government
to take possession of the railroads in order
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>123</a></span>
to avoid the effect of statutes filled with restrictive
and prohibitive provisions. If the railroads
had been operated under private ownership as
the government is now operating them, every
railroad president in the United States would
be in the penitentiary. The roads asked an increase
of fifteen percent in freight rates, which
raised a furore of objection from both shipper
and public, and it was denied. Government
control and operation resulted in a loss of
seventy million dollars the first month. Then
both freight and passenger rates were increased
twenty-five percent, generally, and in many
instances, one hundred percent, and no one
murmured. And still the loss continues. <i>It was
four hundred million dollars the first year of
government operation.</i></p>

<div class='c018'>WILL WE EVER BUILD MORE ROADS?</div>

<p class='c009' >If someone should predict that the last railroad
ever to be built in the United States of
America, has been built, are you prepared to
question its correctness? Will it be necessary to
change our policy if more roads are to be
builded?</p>

<p class='c009' >Listen! Will you invest money in railroad
construction, knowing that if it succeeds you
will be allowed no more than six or eight percent
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_124' id='Page_124'>124</a></span>
on the money wisely spent, and that if,
through misfortune or want of foresight, it fails,
you will lose everything? The theory of public
utility commissions generally, is that if money
is unwisely invested it ought to be lost, and
when it is wisely invested, it should earn about
six percent.</p>

<p class='c009' >Suppose you and I install a hydraulic power
plant and build our dam according to plans and
specifications prepared by a reputable engineer.
Then a flood destroys it and demonstrates that
the money was <i>unwisely spent</i> and, therefore,
according to these commissions, should be lost.
If the dam stands the strain, and if it was wisely
placed, and if it be economically operated, we
will be allowed six percent. Are you ready to
join in an enterprise of this character? If you
will not, who will?</p>

<p class='c009' >Suppose a promoter presents to you an engineer’s
report made from a preliminary survey
of a railroad extending, let us say, from St.
Louis, around through Arkansas and Texas to
Galveston. I am informed that such a report
exists, and that it shows that the road will go
through the largest body of uncut white oak in
the world, extensive pine forests, tap that belt
of zinc ore extending south from Joplin, Missouri,
make available large coal measures, iron
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>125</a></span>
deposits and agricultural areas now obtainable
at less than twenty dollars per acre, but which
with proper transportation facilities, and a progressive
citizenship, would be worth two hundred
dollars per acre. The engineer estimates
that the road when completed will earn twenty
percent on the cost of construction, and you are
asked to buy some of the stock at par. The
statutes of most states forbid the sale of even
initial stock issues for less than par. How much
of this stock will you take? Will your neighbors
and friends want some? How much stock
in an unbuilt railroad do you think can be sold
at any price when good farm lands adjacent can
be bought at twenty-five percent of par?</p>

<p class='c009' >While the wisdom of the modern law-maker
prohibits the sale of stock at less than par few
if any statutes have been enacted, limiting the
price at which bonds may be sold. Suppose you
are offered bonds instead of stock. Possibly you
can get the bonds at less than par. What will
you pay, and how large a block do you desire?
Remember, the road has not yet been built. The
money must be placed in the bank to be used in
construction and you must wait for your interest
until the road has earned it. If you will not
buy, will your neighbors?</p>

<p class='c009' >It will help to solve these problems if you recognize
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>126</a></span>
early in your calculations that men with
much money are not much bigger fools than we
with little. If you and I will not invest in railroad
construction under present conditions, men
of means and experience will not, and the last
railroad ever to be built beneath the Stars and
Stripes is now in operation unless—unless!</p>

<div class='c018'>THE OLD WAY</div>

<p class='c009' >During the half century and more of the
unparalleled growth and development of the
United States, bonds of unbuilt railroads were
offered with fifty percent or more of stock as a
bonus. The estimates indicated that the roads
would earn not only interest on the bonds but
dividends on the stock, and a portion of the
unearned increment resulting from development
was in this way awarded to those who took the
risks. Investors were thus encouraged to expect
reasonable returns, plus fifty percent or more of
water. The promoters who had paid the expenses
of preliminary surveys (often abandoned
as worthless) also labored with hopes of great
gain if they should discover a meritorious proposition.
Those who bought and occupied the
lands contiguous to new roads endured some
hardships but took no risks and yet expected to
add at least four hundred percent of water to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
their investments. They realized in most instances
more than one thousand percent profit
on the original cost.</p>

<p class='c009' >Does anyone doubt that a return to the policy
of apportioning unearned increment equitably
among those who shall in any way contribute to
the general result will revive internal improvements?
No one asks, and no one would consent,
that all the unearned increment should go
to the stockholders of a railroad. Every one
favors governmental supervision and control of
rates. The point where a few diverge from the
mass is in recommending that those whose vision
and courage are solely responsible for development,
shall have an equitable share of the unearned
increment.</p>

<p class='c009' >Lest I be misunderstood, I desire to state
parenthetically that I have never owned a railroad
bond or a share of railroad stock; and I
have never promoted a railroad or been employed
in any capacity by a railroad. Most of
what little I now possess, I have made by watering
the capitalization of real estate. Occasionally,
in times past, when I have known of a
railroad about to be constructed, and have recognized
an opportunity to make a little money
through another man’s vision, on another man’s
courage and at the other man’s risk, I have purchased
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>128</a></span>
a little contiguous real estate, watered
the capitalization from one hundred to one thousand
percent, and then insisted that the road
should haul me and my produce at cost plus
six percent.</p>

<div class='c018'>PIONEER CAPITAL</div>

<p class='c009' >Does it occur to you that pioneer capital
should be accorded pioneer rewards? Pioneer
people make sacrifices, endure hardships, suffer
privations; but in America they take no risks
and their rewards have been certain and speedy.
But their rewards would be neither certain nor
speedy did not pioneer capital precede them,
blaze the way and assume all risks. During the
period when pioneer capital was liberally rewarded,
development outstripped the imagination
of men. It will do the same again if given
like encouragement.</p>

<p class='c009' >I assume that a return of six percent would
be ample on capital, let us say, to construct an
additional track for the Pennsylvania Railroad
between New York and Philadelphia. That
would be improvement capital. Would the
same rate be satisfactory for money invested
in an unbuilt road into an undeveloped country?
To state the case is to state the argument, and
yet no railroad commissioner has yet been created
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>129</a></span>
with both the wisdom and the courage to
stand openly for a distinction between development
capital and pioneer capital. Unless
returns are permitted large enough to induce a
reasonable man to take a risk none will take it,
for the unreasonable man has no money to risk.</p>

<p class='c009' >In a preceding paragraph I referred to the
attempt of Mr. Spreckels to build a railroad
across, or rather through, and much of the way
under, the most barren succession of mountain
peaks and defiles I have ever seen. An automobile
road has been built at great expense
across the mountain. Nine-tenths of the way
not a green leaf or living thing—not even a
bird or insect—will be seen.</p>

<p class='c009' >Mr. Spreckels is a very wealthy man. He is
supposed to own over fifty-one percent of the
gas, electric light, street railways and ferries of
San Diego. He does not, however, consume
fifty-one percent of the food cooked by the gas
he generates; he does not enjoy fifty-one percent
of the light that illuminates that beautiful
little city; he does not take fifty-one percent of
the rides on street car or ferry; and not one percent
of the unearned increment, the advance in
the value of property occasioned by his public-spirited
enterprises, inures to him. Having
more money than he can use and more than his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>
children can legitimately spend, why does he
risk everything on a railroad involving an aggregate
of more than twenty miles of tunnel
through solid granite? I will tell you why.</p>

<p class='c009' >For some reason, let us hope a sufficient reason,
the All-wise Father has implanted in certain
natures somewhat more than the average
vision, somewhat more than the average courage,
somewhat more than the average desire to
achieve, and He seems to have ordained that
these men shall be happy only when achieving.
Service expresses the thought admirably when
he put into the mouth of the returning Klondiker:</p>

<p class='c009' >So it has ever been, and thus it is and ever

</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>Originally the government permitted each to
enjoy the natural advance in the value of his holdings—the
unearned increment. In recent years
it has discriminated and in certain classes of investments
has sought to limit rewards to the
equivalent of reasonable interest rates.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >The first piece of land I ever owned was a
half interest in one hundred and sixty acres.
My law partner and I got four hundred and
eighty dollars together and we bought one hundred
and sixty acres at three dollars per acre.
We put part of it under plow, rented it and
within a few years, sold it. That land is no
more productive today than when we sold it, but
the rascal who owns it has watered the capitalization
until when I buy a pound of butter or
a dozen eggs I am helping to pay him a dividend
on two hundred and fifty dollars per acre.
We watered it a little, ourselves. We sold it,
I remember, for twelve dollars and fifty cents
an acre. That was the first dollar I had ever
received that I had not earned in the hardest
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span>
way. It was the first dollar of unearned increment
that ever came my way. It was the first
water, so to speak, I had ever tasted. I liked it.</p>

<p class='c009' >I remember when John Trumm purchased
that land of us. If he had said to me: “The
country is new, population sparse, commerce
limited; if these conditions change and the land
advances in value, to whom will belong the unearned
increment?” Very promptly I should
have told him it would belong to him. There
was not only a competency but a speculation in
the purchase of that land.</p>

<p class='c009' >But suppose he had said to me: “If I do not
buy this land, I shall put my money into the
Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad that
is now building through the county. The country
is new, the population sparse and commerce
limited. If these conditions change and the railroad
advances in value, to whom will belong the
unearned increment?” In my innocence, I
should have told him it would belong to him.
I might have warned him that if it resulted like
the first three attempts to build a railroad across
Iowa, he would lose every dollar he invested, but
if the time had then arrived, and if the road was
built economically and operated efficiently, and
did prove a success, it doubtless would advance
in value and the unearned increment would belong
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>
to those who had shown great vision, taken
great risk and exercised great skill.</p>

<div class='c018'>SOME CONCRETE CASES</div>

<p class='c009' >I recall a man who purchased in an early day
large bodies of Iowa land at from three to five
dollars per acre. His rentals must have equalled
twenty percent per annum on his investment.
Then he watered the capitalization and sold
these lands at seventy-five dollars per acre.
They are now worth over two hundred dollars
per acre. But, even at seventy-five dollars, they
made him a millionaire, financially. Then he
assailed the railroads for watering their capitalization,
though money invested in a railroad
never yielded a quarter as large returns as his
land investments netted. His opposition to railroads,
however, made him a millionaire, politically.</p>

<p class='c009' >Some years ago a man asked me to join him
and some friends in promoting a railroad to the
coal fields of Alaska. I asked him who owned
the coal and was told that anyone could have all
he cared to buy at a nominal price. I called
attention to a statute that forbade the same men
owning both the railroad and the coal. Then I
proposed that I take the coal and let him and
his friends build the railroad. If they succeeded,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>
I would then go to the Interstate Commerce
Commission and get a rate that would
give them six percent on their investment and
I would take all the profit. I reminded him
that the public thought six percent was enough
for money invested in railroads. The road has
never been built.</p>

<p class='c009' >I met a friend not long ago who, in explaining
that the world had been good to him, told
me that some years before he had bought a
large body of badly located but excellent timber
back in the mountains of Washington, at fifteen
cents per thousand on the stump. Then a railroad
was built up to his holdings. That was
some years ago and during the period of national
development. When the road was completed,
he went to the Interstate Commerce Commission
and got a rate so that he was then selling his
timber, which cost him fifteen cents per thousand,
for five dollars per thousand, while those who
builded the road are presumably getting six or
eight percent on their investment and will until
the timber is exhausted, when their road will be
worthless. My friend is not a reactionary but
is far-sighted. I think he said he studied finance
from the standpoint of a farmer.</p>

<p class='c009' >A few years ago, at a Chamber of Commerce
dinner in New York, Myron K. Jessup asked
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>135</a></span>
me if I knew that he was once president of a
railroad in Iowa. The road extended from
Dubuque to Farley. I asked him if he remembered
when an engineer by the name of Smith
made a preliminary survey from Farley to
Sioux City, and reported that there was nothing
west of Iowa Falls worth building a railroad
into. “Remember it!” said he. “He made that
report to me.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Think of it. A man living and in good health
in 1906 who was old enough to be the president
of a railroad at a time when two-thirds of the
north half of Iowa was considered not worth
developing. Ultimately the road was constructed
and I happened to be at Storm Lake
when the last spike was driven connecting the
two ends of the road. This was in 1870. That
whole stretch of country could have been bought
at that time at an average of less than five dollars
per acre. I remember riding forty miles
without seeing a house. The lands I saw that
day could not have been sold for two dollars and
are now worth two hundred dollars per acre.</p>

<p class='c009' >These lands were worthless without the railroad
and the railroad relatively worthless without
the lands. The lands, exclusive of improvements,
have paid in rentals more than twenty
percent on their cost and their present value is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>
ninety-nine-one-hundredths water. No money
invested in railroads or any other industry ever
yielded returns comparable with that.</p>

<p class='c009' >The wealth of the United States, estimated at
two hundred and fifty billion dollars, is probably
ninety percent water. Farm lands, timber
lands, mineral lands, oil lands, town lots, originally
cost very little. Deducting improvements,
interest and taxes from rents and returns already
received, plus the market value, and the
difference is the unearned increment or the water
that has been added to the original capitalization.</p>

<p class='c009' >Suppose, if you please, we are just opening
a new country. What policy would you recommend?
Would you expect each one to attempt
everything? Or would you encourage a division
of labor and enterprise? I fancy we would follow
the policy the Fathers adopted. We would
encourage the improvements of lands, the construction
of transportation facilities, the building
of mills and factories, of stores and banks, the
opening of mines and the development of water
power, and then we would tacitly agree that
whoever contributed in any manner to the common
good should share equitably in the resultant
unearned increment.</p>

  <h2 id='chXX' class='c019'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />BUSINESS PHILOSOPHIES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>This is a preliminary chapter intended to show
that management is the most essential factor in
every business proposition. Several illustrations
are given, and some advice offered.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >Before discussing government construction,
ownership and operation of railroads, and other
so-called public utilities, I want to call attention
to some well-known but seldom recognized
principles.</p>

<p class='c009' >All business stands on three legs. No business
can stand on two legs. Notwithstanding
the persistent nonsense that has emanated from
press and platform, from pulpit and professor’s
chair, by thoughtless politician and thoughtful
demagogue, capital and labor, unaided, have
never accomplished anything and never will.
But management, plus capital, plus labor, have
done wonders and still greater achievements
await the cooperation of this irresistible trinity.</p>

<p class='c009' >Some have tried to make it appear that the
public constitutes a fourth leg. While the public
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span>
has rights, and affords markets, business succeeds
only when the public does not interfere.</p>

<p class='c009' >Take the case of the farmer. His lands, his
tools, his teams and other livestock, constitute
his capital. He performs the labor, furnishes
the management, and all goes well. Occasionally
a farmer prospers when he furnishes only
capital and management, notwithstanding Benjamin
Franklin’s proverb: “He who on a farm
would thrive, must either hold the plow or
drive.” The one absolutely indispensable element
of success in farming is management. No
man ever prospered on a farm simply because
he worked. He must wisely manage if he lifts
the mortgage. When the farmer’s management
fails, the sheriff becomes his land agent, and it
matters not how productive his land, or how
willing his team, or how fruitful his flock or
how hard he works.</p>

<p class='c009' >You never knew a merchant to fail except
when his management buckled. You may have
thought some failures were due to want of capital;
but even in these instances management
was solely at fault, for it attempted too much
with its available capital. Barring accidental
and incidental fortune, good or ill, management
or the want of it is the prime factor in every
success and in every failure.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
The president of a certain Chicago federation
of labor, after listening to this thought, brought
a party of friends to my platform and in the
course of a brief visit said: “They have talked
to us about capital and labor, capital and labor,
nothing but capital and labor. We knew there
was another guy in there but we couldn’t find
him.” Then he added: “And you have got to
pay that guy, too.”</p>

<div class='c018'>ILLUSTRATIVE INSTANCES</div>

<p class='c009' >Some years ago and during the period of evolution
in harvest machinery, Marsh Brothers put
upon the market what was known as the Marsh
Harvester. It was the first radical improvement
upon the old self-rake. Two men rode upon the
machine and bound the grain as it was cut. For
some reason, perhaps disagreement among the
interested parties, the concern was reorganized
into three independent companies and certain
territory was allotted to each. A local preacher
by the name of Gammon took one allotment,
associated with him William Deering, and the
largest manufacturing plant then in the world
was built where nothing had stood before. The
other two concerns took equally favorable territory,
operated under the same patents, obtained
their capital in the same market, hired labor at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_140' id='Page_140'>140</a></span>
the same wage, and utterly failed. Five years
thereafter nothing remained except court records
to show they had ever existed.</p>

<p class='c009' >Did capital build the Deering plant? It did
not. Did labor do it? By no manner of means.
The germ of management in the brain cells of
William Deering, which no crucible would disclose
and no scalpel reveal, was wholly and alone
responsible. Do you suggest that able subordinates
and efficient labor were in part responsible?
My answer is that William Deering was
wholly responsible for having able subordinates
and efficient labor. Andrew Carnegie said to
me: “I have never been able to discover wherein
I have been more clever than others except in
selecting men cleverer than I.” That is the
acme of clever management, and affords the
only certainty of success.</p>

<p class='c009' >During a congressional investigation of the
meat industry the president of one of the “big
five” packing houses appeared, and in the course
of his examination testified that while holding a
position of considerable responsibility to which
he had been gradually advanced, he was asked
to organize a company to take over a certain
concern, the stock of which was selling at about
ten dollars per share. The necessary capital was
tendered and he was offered a salary of one
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>
hundred and fifty thousand dollars per year,
quite a large block of stock gratis and an option
on thirty-five thousand shares at ten dollars per
share, which he subsequently exercised. When
asked if he thought his salary was unreasonably
large, he called attention to the fact that within
ten years his company had become one of the
five largest in the world and that its stock had
advanced from ten dollars per share to par.
Thereupon the chairman of the committee remarked
that while he was opposed to large
salaries, he thought that one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars per annum was not excessive
for this particular witness. Did capital accomplish
that? Did labor? No, management did it.</p>

<div class='c018'>SUPPOSE A CASE</div>

<p class='c009' >In a certain city a thousand men are out of
employment. In a bank in that city a million
dollars are out of employment. In the foothills
near the city fifty million tons of coal are out
of employment. The unemployed men see the
opportunity and offer their joint note for the
money with which to develop a coal mine. But
the officers of the bank will not lend money that
does not belong to them upon the signature of a
thousand men, each out of employment. Then
management walks in and says to the president
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>142</a></span>
of the bank: “I am a practical coal operator.
I have had experience, and have associated with
me a board of directors, each a successful coal
producer. In proof that we understand what
we are undertaking, here is the report of the
best-known coal engineer in the world, who at
our expense has bored every square rod of that
tract of coal, showing the exact number of tons
available. Here also is an assay showing the
quality of the coal. It is worth so much per
ton on the track. It will cost so and so to put
it on the track. After we have invested a million
dollars of our own money, we want to borrow
a million to complete the development and
for working capital.” By giving a majority of
the stock, and all the bonds of the company as
collateral, and by each director signing the note,
the money is obtained. The hitherto idle men
are now employed and a great industry results.
Query: Locate the cause. Is it capital? Capital
languished and earned nothing. Is it labor?
Labor was in rags and labor’s children were
crying for bread. That coal field is developed,
the wealth of the nation increased, homes are
warmed, furnaces made to glow, wheels to turn,
by management, plus capital, plus labor. It is
so everywhere, in each and every instance, in
this and all other lands.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span>
Capital can usually be had upon approved
security, and labor is most always available at a
satisfactory wage, but management, the one
essential of every achievement, is the most difficult
thing in the world to find and, when discovered,
imposes its own conditions and names
its reward.</p>

<div class='c018'>A WORD OF ADVICE</div>

<p class='c009' >If teachers of economics and of sociology
would somewhat oftener and more generally
teach the Benjamin Franklin brand of common
sense and make their classes understand that
there are in the United States vastly more
twenty-five thousand dollar jobs than there are
twenty-five thousand dollar men to fill them,
bolshevism would diminish as rapidly as it has
increased under the opposite tuition. Where do
our editors and newspaper writers come from?
Whence the principals of our high schools, teachers
in our colleges, preachers and lawyers?
Ninety percent of them are from our colleges
and universities, and those who graduate with
socialistic and bolshevistic tendencies have usually
imbibed them either from imported professors
or from American professors who have received
their Ph.D’s in Germany.</p>

<p class='c009' >In this connection I also want to say a word
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>144</a></span>
to parents: Would it not be well early in the
life of your boy to impress upon him that he
will probably get out of life something fairly
commensurate with what he puts into life? You
might also suggest that if he will observe he
will probably discover that those who complain
most because the world has been stingy with
them, are seldom able to show a receipt for much
that they have contributed to the world. If instead
of giving wholesome guidance you permit
to go unchallenged the teachings which your boy
is certain to get in the school room, in the pew,
at the theater and the movie, on the street, and
especially from the demagogue, that those who
make money are invariably dishonest, those who
accumulate wealth are scoundrels and that those
who amass fortunes should be in the penitentiary,
I will go security for your son that he
will never disgrace his parents by getting the
family name on the letterhead of any big institution,
or in the Directory of Directors.</p>

  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c019'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />THE GOVERNMENT’S HANDICAP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>In this chapter an argument is made that no
government, and especially no republic, can supply
the necessary management for business enterprises.
The effect of popular and political interference
with public business is illustrated.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >The principal reason why government business
operations are always financial failures is
that no republic can supply the all-essential
third leg. Its management is always defective.
It can furnish capital, it can employ labor, but
in a government where the people have a voice,
management always buckles.</p>

<p class='c009' >Senator Aldrich was frequently quoted as
saying that the government could save three
hundred million dollars per annum if it would
apply business principles to its affairs. The
distinguished senator never said that. What he
did say was that the government <i>would</i> save
three hundred million dollars per annum if it
<i>could</i> apply business principles. Experience had
taught the senator what experience has taught
everyone who has had experience and what
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>146</a></span>
observation has taught the observing: that it
cannot be done.</p>

<p class='c009' >During the campaign of 1916, I sat on the
platform and heard the then candidate for governor
of a great middle-west state tell an audience
that if he were elected governor, he would
apply business principles to state affairs. I followed
him and told his hearers that, if elected,
he would do nothing of the kind. In the first
place, it was impossible, and, secondly, they
would not consent to it even if it were possible.
I reminded them that I knew better than their
candidate, for I had tried it. I did suggest,
however, that simply because business principles
cannot be applied to public affairs, is no excuse
for conducting public affairs in a thoroughly
unbusinesslike manner. It is not necessary to
violate every business principle because some
cannot be applied.</p>

<p class='c009' >The candidate was elected, as he deserved to
be, and has made one of the best, many say the
best, governor his state ever had. But he will
have to admit that he cannot remove officials
simply for inefficiency, and he cannot make appointments
in the face of public opposition, however
fit and worthy the applicant. In a thousand
ways he cannot exercise the independent
discretion which he would if president of a bank
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_147' id='Page_147'>147</a></span>
or the head of some industrial corporation.</p>

<p class='c009' >When I took charge of the Treasury Department
I found an appraiser at one of the principal
ports who had outlived his usefulness. He
was not dishonest. Dishonesty is the least of all
evils of government service. He was simply inefficient.
He had a good army record, was a
very reputable gentleman, highly esteemed, absolutely
honest, and Mr. McKinley had made
him appraiser. There were many evidences of
inefficiency. Importers at far distant ports were
entering their merchandise at this city and shipping
them back home, manifestly for the purpose
of evading the payment of appropriate
duties. I have no doubt that the government
was losing a million dollars or more a year
through the inefficiency of this good man.</p>

<p class='c009' >President Roosevelt authorized a change. I
informed the two senators from that state what
had to be done, and asked them to select the
best man they could find and I would arrange
a vacancy to meet their convenience. President
Lincoln is credited with saying that when he had
twenty applicants for a position and appointed
one, he made nineteen enemies and one ingrate.
I wanted to protect these senators from nineteen
enemies.</p>

<p class='c009' >They found an excellent man and I had the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_148' id='Page_148'>148</a></span>
old appraiser come to Washington. He fully
recognized his utter failure, and willingly resigned.
We parted friends. The inexperienced
will suppose that was the end of the incident.
It was not. It was the beginning of it. The
removal was declared to be purely a political
deal. The President was criticized, I was abused
and the two senators maligned. Every prominent
Grand Army man in the country was asked
to protest, and most of them did, until this dear
old fellow was made to believe he had been imposed
upon. He published his grievances in an
extended interview and in about three months
died of a broken heart.</p>

<p class='c009' >The people will not consent that public affairs
shall be conducted as business is conducted.
Had this man been in the employ of a business
enterprise in any large city, his removal would
not have elicited so much as a notice that he had
resigned for the purpose of giving attention to
his “long-neglected private affairs.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Public opposition to the application of business
principles to government affairs is well
illustrated in the location and erection of public
buildings. Chicago has a federal building which
was intended to accommodate, and does hold,
not only the post office, but serves as court house,
custom house and shelters all other federal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_149' id='Page_149'>149</a></span>
offices. It cost nine million dollars and is ill-suited
for anything. There are plenty of architects
who can design a court house, or a post
office, or an office building, but no one has yet
appeared, and no one ever will be found, who
can combine the three without ruining all.</p>

<p class='c009' >During the period of construction, the Chicago
post office occupied temporary quarters on
the lake front in a wooden building, veneered
with brick, built expressly for the purpose. Unquestionably
it was the most convenient, and
therefore the best post office in the United
States. This of course is from the standpoint
of a business man. Everyone connected with it
regretted its abandonment for the huge, imposing
but outrageous new building. The architect’s
pride centered in its enormous dome. All
the mail had to be taken from the basement up
a steep incline and, until they began using heavy
gasoline trucks, it required four horses to pull
out from under the building what one horse
could haul to the depot.</p>

<p class='c009' >Pittsburgh wanted a building equally imposing,
and Congress appropriated a million dollars
to buy a site. That sum would pay for nothing
suitable in the central part of the city. The
newspapers had all purchased property at the
top of the hill, in the newer part of the city,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_150' id='Page_150'>150</a></span>
and the Secretary of the Treasury was expected
to locate the Federal Building accordingly. He
did not do so and for this reason: There were
no street cars going near the proposed site. It
was before the advent of gasoline trucks and
the mail would have to be hauled up the long
inclines by teams. In slippery weather a team
of horses, unless freshly shod, cannot climb that
hill with an empty wagon.</p>

<p class='c009' >Inspired by the experience at Chicago, the
Secretary decided to give Pittsburgh the best
post-office service in the world. An entire block
near the principal depot was purchased, at fifty
percent or more above its market value. But
that was relatively cheaper than anything else
offered, and less proportionately than what the
government is usually compelled to pay. A
suitable site for a business enterprise employing
a like number of people, and doing an equal
volume of business, would be tendered on a
silver platter. The people’s government never
got “something for nothing” until we entered
the war. What it then got and where it got it
is quite generally surmised.</p>

<p class='c009' >The intention was to erect a steel-framed post
office, not more than three stories high, with
wide court, so the light would be abundant, install
a system of pneumatic or electric carriers,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
with tubes extending to all the depots and substations
of the city. This, I submit, is exactly
what any business concern would have done.
But it was not satisfactory. A perfect furore
was raised, every bit of which had its root either
in a hope of profit through the location of the
building, or in a desire for a big and imposing
public building with an enormous dome. The
people thought it a shame that Pittsburgh should
be asked to put up with the expenditure of a
fraction of the money that had been thrown
away in Chicago, and the fact that one hour
would be saved in the distribution and delivery
of every piece of mail, did not palliate the
offense. A post office erected solely for the purpose
of efficient mail service will satisfy no community.</p>

<p class='c009' >There are quite a large number of ports of
entry where the entire revenue collected is not
enough to pay the expenses of the office. In my
annual reports I recommend that several of
these be abolished, but no congressman from
those states would support such a recommendation
and no congressman from any other state
would favor it lest economies applicable to his
own locality would be thus invited. Everyone
insists upon economy in government matters,
but all demand that it be exercised in a distant
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_152' id='Page_152'>152</a></span>
state, and preferably in some territory or in
the District of Columbia where the franchise
is denied.</p>

<p class='c009' >Many will remember William S. Holman of
Indiana, for many years chairman of the Committee
on Appropriations. He was not only an
able man but a wise and economical statesman,
and merited the appellation by which he was
internationally known, “The Watchdog of the
Treasury.” The Committee on Rivers and
Harbors, desiring his support, inserted an item
for dredging a creek extending into Holman’s
district, so ships could come to central Indiana.
Of course Mr. Holman wanted to be returned
and was therefore compelled to support the bill.
He even made a short speech in favor of this
particular item. When he closed, Tom Reed
arose to remark in his inimitable drawl,</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c024'   >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis sweet to hear the honest watchdog’s bark,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bay deep-mouthed welcome as he draws near home.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c018'>A SELF-EVIDENT FACT</div>

<p class='c009' >No government subordinate or bureau chief
ever got into difficulty except when he did something.
No one ever knew a refusal to act, or a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span>
delay in acting, to be the subject of judicial or
legislative investigation. Pigeonholes all filled
is infinitely safer than a few signed documents.
This is fully recognized throughout the whole
realm of public service and the result is logical—everything
of a decisive nature is deferred as
long as possible.</p>

<p class='c009' >In 1906 Congress authorized the Secretary of
the Treasury to settle a claim for ice sold to the
government for the use of the Union Army in
1863. I am the only official who, in more than
forty years, could have been impeached for
action taken in connection with that knotty
problem.</p>

<p class='c009' >Subordinates in corporations and private business
are criticised and lose their positions for
failure to act. With the government, men are
discharged and disgraced only when they do act.
Unless a clerk or bureau chief or head of a
department is caught red-handed, so there can
be no question of guilt, there is no way to rid
the department of an incubus without great difficulty.
What I am trying to emphasize is a fact
that everyone knows, few recognize, fewer still
admit and many deny, to-wit: That government,
state and municipal affairs are necessarily
conducted upon entirely different principles
from ordinary business.</p>

<div class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>
TWO ARMY INCIDENTS</div>

<p class='c009' >I am indebted to an army officer for the following,
which I have not verified and therefore
cannot vouch for, but I give it simply because
it is absolutely true to life.</p>

<p class='c009' >During the Indian insurrections in Texas, a
certain officer got word to his quartermaster that
he must have supplies and ammunition at a
given point on the Rio Grande River without
delay or his detachment would be annihilated.
The quartermaster must have been a civilian
for, regardless of red tape and formality, he
proceeded to act. He found a boat and sought
to engage it. But the river was low and the
owner dared not attempt the trip. “But,” said
the quartermaster, “if you do not go, those men
will be annihilated.” “If I do go,” said the
owner, “my boat will be annihilated, and it’s the
only boat I have. You have more men.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Rather than fail, the quartermaster purchased
the boat for twelve thousand dollars. He loaded
it with supplies and ammunition, started it up
the river and made his report. Promptly, the
department at Washington refused to ratify the
purchase, and reprimanded the quartermaster
severely for exceeding his authority in purchasing
a boat. I submit that the department was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>155</a></span>
right. No member of Congress would vote to
give a quartermaster authority to buy a river
steamer. Even the Secretary of the Navy
would need congressional authorization. Fortunately,
the boat returned and the quartermaster
tried to get the man to take it back. He refused.
Then the quartermaster found a purchaser,
sold the boat for twelve thousand five
hundred dollars, paid the purchase price and
sent five hundred dollars to Washington.
Promptly the department refused to ratify the
sale and again reprimanded the quartermaster
because he had sold a boat without authority.
And the department was again right. Congress
never has given and never will give authority
to a quartermaster or anyone to sell a boat or
anything else except after prolonged condemnation
proceedings, and then at auction. Any corporation,
under like circumstances, would have
made that quartermaster a vice-president. Instead
his pay was held up, and he faced court
martial until some comptroller risked his official
life and reputation by closing the account, also
in violation of law.</p>

<p class='c009' >If I remember correctly, it was Colonel Phillips
of the regular army who gave me this
chapter from his experience: While in command
at a frontier post he was asked by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>156</a></span>
department to make a recommendation concerning
a certain matter. Following the regulations,
he referred the matter to his quartermaster. The
quartermaster reported favorably to the colonel
in command, and he, as colonel, joined in the
recommendation and sent it to Washington. In
due time he received instructions to proceed and,
again obeying regulations, he directed the quartermaster
to carry out the instructions of the
department. This was done and the quartermaster
so reported to the colonel in command,
and the colonel approved this report and forwarded
it to the department. All of this was
regular and would afford no occasion for comment
but for the fact that Colonel Phillips, the
officer in command, was also quartermaster. He
had asked himself what had best be done, made
his report to himself, approved the report made
to himself, joined in his own recommendation,
then directed himself what to do, reported to
himself that it had been done and then, as commander
of the post, had transmitted all the
papers to the department, which, in course of
time, were approved, and one more closed incident
in the military affairs of the United States
of America resulted. He had signed the same
paper seven times and there had been no way
to abbreviate.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
I submit that if he had been in charge of railroad
operations, some congestion of freight
would have resulted while all these necessary
formalities were being worked out.</p>

<p class='c009' >I want it definitely understood that in recording
these instances, no criticism is intended.
No material improvement ever can be made
without throwing wide open every conceivable
door and shutter through which fraud and corruption
not only can creep but leap and run.
I give them for no other purpose than to prove
established principles to which there are few if
any exceptions, to-wit: That a republic in
business is an ass.</p>

  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c019'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />THE POST OFFICE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>The common belief that the Post Office Department
is conducted along approved business
methods is sought to be dissipated.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >The advocates of government ownership continually
remind you that the Post Office Department
is a government managed affair. It is,
and I think I am perfectly safe in saying that
until the government took control of the railroads,
cables, telegraph and telephone lines, commenced
building ships and constructing airplanes,
it was the worst managed institution on
the face of the earth. And it has mattered little,
if any, which political party has had control of
its affairs.</p>

<p class='c009' >For six years every new post office erected in
the United States has borne upon its corner
stone this inscription: “William G. McAdoo,
Secretary of the Treasury.” As you have seen
this evidence of official prominence in city after
city in every state of the Union, have you wondered
why the name of the Postmaster General
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>159</a></span>
did not appear above, or below, or at least on
the rear of the building? It is simply because
the Postmaster General has nothing in the world
to do with the selection of sites, erection of buildings,
or in their care or improvement. The
Treasury Department buys and pays for the
sites, prepares the plans, erects the buildings,
repairs them, lights them, heats and janitors
them. It also pays the rent of post office quarters
where the government has not been as yet
foolish enough to build. The Treasury Department
also audits the accounts of all postmasters
and not one dollar of all this expense is charged
to postal receipts. Even the salary of the Postmaster
General and all his clerks is paid from
appropriations independent of postal revenues.
Then, with no rent to pay, no coal or current to
buy, with janitor and elevator service gratis and
accounts audited, the Post Office Department
has run behind an aggregate of something over
two hundred million dollars. Any express company
would be glad to take the Post Office
Department off the hands of the government if
it could have free rent, free coal, the salaries of
their principal officers paid and all their accounts
audited gratis, for sixty-five per cent of what it
now costs the government to take care of our
mail service.</p>

RIVERS AND HARBORS</div>

<p class='c009' >Under the Constitution, Congress has charge
of all navigable streams and harbors and it has
spent billions in their improvement. Colonel
Hepburn once made the statement on the floor
of the House that the appropriations for the
improvement of the channel of the Mississippi
River between St. Louis and the Gulf were
sufficient to have built a ship canal of boiler iron
between these two points. No one ever questioned
the correctness of the statement.</p>

<p class='c009' >A recent River and Harbor bill contained an
appropriation to dredge the channel of a stream
in Texas where the government’s engineers reported
there was only one inch of water. Another
brook in Arkansas with only six inches of
water, got an appropriation. I assume that two
more votes were necessary. I might add for
the reader’s information that any stream in the
United States can be made navigable in law by
a joint resolution of the two Houses of Congress
saying that it is navigable. Lawyers
would call that navigable <i>de jure</i> but many of
them cannot be made navigable <i>de facto</i> however
much is expended in dredging and widening.</p>

  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c019'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />CIVIL SERVICE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>The sole purpose of discussing the Civil Service
System in this connection is to show what must
ensue if the government continues its trend and
enlarges its business operations. Partisan politics
cannot be eliminated, neither does the Civil Service
secure the most efficient. Concrete and
actual instances are given as illustrations.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >So much has been said in favor of Civil
Service by its friends, and so much criticism
offered by those who know little about it, that
I am impelled to submit a few observations
drawn from five years’ experience at the head
of a department having, a portion of the time,
as high as twenty thousand people on its payroll,
over ninety percent of whom were in the classified
service.</p>

<p class='c009' >It is not my purpose to criticise or commend.
I do intend, however, to make reasonably clear
some of the inevitable conditions that would
ensue if the government should remain operator
or should become owner and operator of railroads,
merchant ships, express, cable, telegraph
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>162</a></span>
and telephone companies, and other public utilities,
constructor of airplanes, merchant ships,
and logically producers of all materials and
supplies therefor.</p>

<p class='c009' >Everyone concedes that to avoid complete
partisan prostitution of these widely-extended
and diversified interests, every agent, servant
and employee, with the possible exception of
unskilled laborers, would have to be covered
under Civil Service. This would palliate the
evil but, as we shall presently see, would not
prevent political manipulation and influence, and
would render efficient service absolutely impossible.</p>

<p class='c009' >It will be idle to approach this subject without
recognizing a very marked distinction between
business operations and government service.
Business is conducted primarily for the profit
that legitimately results. The wise man knows,
however, that the better the service, the more
certain his rewards. The merchant who best
serves his customers will have the most customers
to serve, and the lawyer who best protects
his clients will have the largest and the most
lucrative practice. Service and profit are seldom
divorced. If it be true, as has been said, that a
grateful people will make a beaten path to the
door of him who improves a mousetrap, it is also
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
equally true that the world’s financial rewards
are liberal beyond calculation to him who renders
any substantial service.</p>

<p class='c009' >This principle does not apply to government
matters. Here the ultimate end is not profit,
but power. While a political party may hope
to be continued if its service is acceptable, it has
no right to expect its administration will be acceptable
if it neglects the ordinary methods by
which approval is secured—which is politics. In
politics, everything reasonable and honest is
made to serve the ends of politics, exactly as in
business everything reasonable and honest is
made to contribute to profit.</p>

<p class='c009' >A most natural result of public service is
loyalty to superiors. This is true in a very
marked degree in all government departments.
If government clerks were to vote, I suppose
three-fourths of them would support the party
in power, without regard to which party it happened
to be. One-half of the balance would
fear even to vote lest they might cause offense
and prejudice their promotion—the sole consideration
with many department clerks—while
only a comparative few would openly support
the opposite party and some of these would subsequently
regret it.</p>

<p class='c009' >A case is current where an official who is supposed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
not to be devoid of future political ambition,
said to a friend who had witnessed the
obsequious servility of subordinates: “There are
two million of these and every one is a voter.”</p>

<p class='c009' >You will recognize that no promotion, demotion
or dismissal within a business organization
invites newspaper comment or criticism from
friend or foe. In government service the exact
opposite is the rule. When constituents inform
a congressman that someone from his district
has had his salary reduced, the whole delegation
from that state get busy. Let it be known that
some clerk has been longer in a department than
another who has received more promotion, and
an explanation is certain to be demanded, and it
is relatively useless to urge inefficiency as the
cause. In such cases the public ascribes but two
causes, politics and favoritism.</p>

<p class='c009' >While “offensive partisanship” is publicly forbidden,
it is generally recognized on the inside
that no activity of a partisan character is “offensive”
so long as it is quiet, and is exercised in
favor of the party in power. Public officials,
of the rank of postmasters, customs and internal
revenue collectors, and district attorneys are not
expected to be delegates to political conventions,
but I have never known their superiors, when of
the same political faith, to object to their being
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_165' id='Page_165'>165</a></span>
in the town while the convention is in session,
maintaining suitable headquarters at the hotel,
and even volunteering valuable advice to those
who happen to call, as well as to those who are
sent for.</p>

<p class='c009' >But politics is not the only weakness of the
system. The public has been taught to believe
that Civil Service examinations result in securing
the most efficient. This is a serious delusion.</p>

<p class='c009' >Those who take civil service examinations
usually find their names rejected or upon the
eligible list within six months. It takes about
that long to classify. Any time within two years
thereafter the applicant is liable to be certified
and called.</p>

<p class='c009' >When a requisition is made the Commission
certifies three names. It is not at all likely that
they are the three whose examinations show
them the best qualified. That question is not
considered—applicants either pass or fail. They
are simply the three names at the head of the
list from the state whose quota is not exhausted.
The officer calling for the clerk examines the
records of the certified names and makes a
selection. Thereupon the applicant is notified
to present himself at a given place where the
minimum salary—in normal times seven hundred
dollars per annum—awaits him. Even though
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_166' id='Page_166'>166</a></span>
he took his examination only twelve months before,
the chances are he declines, giving as his
reason that he is now getting a thousand dollars
with good prospects of promotion.</p>

<p class='c009' >It is only a question of time, however, when
some applicant will be found who, during the
period between examination and certification,
varying from six months to two years and six
months, has been unable to get a job at seven
hundred dollars and he jumps at the chance to
“serve his country.”</p>

<p class='c009' >You knew this must be the way but probably
you had not stopped to analyze it. The Civil
Service screen is so constructed as to catch the
small fish and allow the large ones to escape.
And there is no way known to man to change it
without opening wide the door for favoritism,
which the Civil Service system is supposed to
close and effectively bar.</p>

<p class='c009' >Nevertheless some of the clerks and employees
selected in this way develop a good degree of
efficiency and prove far better than anyone
would expect from an inspection of the machinery
by which they are secured. With
scarcely an exception they are honest and conscientious
toilers, with very little ambition. A
few have ambition but these should, and usually
do, soon resign.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_167' id='Page_167'>167</a></span>
I have in mind a business organization with
several thousand on its payroll. Its operations
extend from ocean to ocean and its employees
include geologists, chemists, engineers of every
kind, purchasing agents, salesmen, superintendents
of both construction and transportation,
clerks, clear down to unskilled laborers. Everyone
connected with the organization is made to
understand that any position is open to him provided
he can show greater efficiency than the
incumbent. While most of the force have grown
up within the organization, not all have been
started at the minimum salary nor promoted because
of length of service. The former is insisted
upon, and the latter urged, by all friends
of Civil Service.</p>

<p class='c009' >Imagine such a concern as I have described,
depending upon an outside commission to examine
and certify the people whom it might
employ in its clerical and technical force, and
being bound by its own by-laws not to employ
anyone selected in any other way. No business
concern could face competition and survive
under such a system. Yet everyone recognizes
that when applied to government affairs, Civil
Service is not only the best but the only way.
I am not criticising it. I am only showing the
inevitable result if we change the purpose of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>168</a></span>
government from the greatest liberty institution
in the world to a corporation for the transaction
of business.</p>

<p class='c009' >During five years that I recruited the force
of the Treasury Department from names certified
by the Civil Service Commission, nothing
occurred to engender ill feeling. The members
of the Commission and the officers of the Treasury
Department understood each other perfectly
and sympathized. Every member of the Commission
sought as best he could—subject, of
course, to the restrictions and limitations of his
office—to serve the Treasury Department, and
the Secretary of the Treasury, believing in Civil
Service, reciprocated. There were, however,
some rather plain and expressive letters exchanged.
Believing that letters that actually
passed between departments are the best proof
of conditions as they exist, I have inserted in
the Appendix the material correspondence covering
four distinct cases.</p>

<p class='c009' >Some of the letters were answered by personal
interviews but enough remains to show the cordial
feeling that existed, as well as the nature of
the contentions. It also reveals the earnestness
with which the Secretary of the Treasury sought
some relaxation in the rules which friends of the
system, as well as the members of the Commission,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_169' id='Page_169'>169</a></span>
insist must be rigidly enforced, and which
were rigidly enforced.</p>

<p class='c009' >The last case cited relates to a request for
experienced lawyers for special agents of the
Treasury Department. The necessity for these
will be apparent to every experienced business
man.</p>

<p class='c009' >Many of the tariff rates are <i>ad valorem</i>, the
duty being levied upon the foreign market value
of the imported merchandise. Importers are required
to enter their goods at the price at which
such articles are usually bought and sold in the
country of their origin. Undervaluation by unscrupulous
importers is the most common way
of defrauding the government. Cases of
alleged undervaluation are tried by the Board of
General Appraisers, at which the importers are
represented by lawyers who make a specialty of
this class of cases. They are not only men of
experience but many of them possess great natural
aptitude. Some, I suppose, make as high
as fifty thousand dollars per annum. The government
is represented by attorneys who receive,
if I remember correctly, three thousand dollars
per annum, and the cases are usually prepared
by special agents, or special employees, who receive
from fifteen hundred to two thousand
dollars per annum. The government is at a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
tremendous disadvantage. I have heard it estimated
that the Treasury loses two hundred million
dollars per annum through undervaluations.
I think this is excessive but unquestionably it
runs into tens of millions.</p>

<p class='c009' >I desired several country lawyers who had
had actual experience in trying cases, and asked
the Civil Service Commission to provide an
eligible list. The need of capable men in this
particular branch of the service is well illustrated
by the following incidents.</p>

<p class='c009' >Certain importers were entering their merchandise,
which had been paid for in Indian
rupees, as costing the bullion value of rupees,
about twenty cents. England was maintaining
the parity of the rupee at about fifty cents in
our money. The Secretary of the Treasury certified
that the rupee was worth fifty cents and
directed that duties be collected accordingly. As
was anticipated, the importers all paid under
protest and one of them prosecuted an appeal.
A decision against the government was rendered
by the Board of General Appraisers and by all
the courts including the Supreme Court of the
United States. I ordered that another case be
made and gave instructions how it should be
prepared. Again, much to my surprise, the government
was defeated. Investigation showed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>171</a></span>
that the second case had been prepared exactly
like the first. More detailed instructions were
given and the government was successful, and
more than one million dollars that had been paid
by importers under protest, was saved to the
government and at least two hundred thousand
dollars per annum from then until now. Any
country lawyer with a general practice would
have known how to prepare and present the
case in the first instance.</p>

<p class='c009' >The Treasury Department has several special
agents in Europe whose business it is to look
after and discover evidence of undervaluation,
as well as other frauds upon the revenues of the
country. The Department knew that certain
merchandise was viciously undervalued, but the
special agents all failed to get material evidence.
Special employees were not then under Civil
Service and I got an up-state lawyer from New
York to accept a position as special employee,
sent him to Europe and he came back with
evidence that secured advances in valuations
which saved the government perhaps fifty thousand
dollars a year from one importer alone.</p>

<p class='c009' >Appendix “D” will show the material correspondence
concerning this particular request for
experienced trial lawyers. My first request is
dated September 20, 1905; my second, October
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_172' id='Page_172'>172</a></span>
14th of the same year. Finally the Commission
replied and its first letter bears date of December
2, 1905. It mentions oral requests also
having been made. Several examinations were
held but up to the time I left the Treasury
Department, March 4, 1907, no eligible list had
been provided containing a single lawyer who
had ever prepared or tried a case in any court.
The department needed at least six, could have
profitably used twelve, but could not and did
not get one. If interested read Appendix “D.”
You will detect enough spice to give it a flavor
not its own.</p>

<p class='c009' >The correspondence set out in Appendix “C”
has reference to a tobacco examiner. Tobacco
intended for Florida was being imported from
Cuba at a certain inland city and then shipped
back to Tampa and Key West. The duty on
unstemmed wrapper tobacco was at that time
$1.85 per pound and only 35 cents per pound
on unstemmed filler tobacco. When any bale
of tobacco contained more than fifteen per cent
wrapper, the entire bale was dutiable as wrapper.
There was a further provision that tobacco from
two or more provinces or dependencies, if mixed,
should be dutiable at $1.85 per pound, regardless
of its character. Naturally, a tobacco examiner
should know something about tobacco. In fact,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_173' id='Page_173'>173</a></span>
that is the only subject that a tobacco examiner
need know anything about. The correspondence
will show the efforts made to secure one and
the desire of the Civil Service Commission to
aid, as well as the disaster which it believed
would follow if the Treasury Department was
allowed any voice in the manner of the examination
or in classification of those who took the
same.</p>

<p class='c009' >Appendix “B” has reference to a tea examiner,
another position that, in the opinion of
the Secretary of the Treasury, should be filled
by an expert.</p>

<p class='c009' >The correspondence with reference to a tobacco
examiner began some time in 1904. My
first rejection of each of the three names certified
as being eligible is dated December 15, 1904.
The request for a tea examiner was made somewhat
later. I quote a paragraph from the Civil
Service Commission’s letter of December 9,
1905, which, though written with special reference
to the request for eligible trial lawyers,
mentions both tobacco and tea examiners:</p>

<p class='c009' >“Your attention is also invited to the recent
examination for tea examiner and tobacco examiner
at the Port of ——. Owing to
objections by your Department to eligibles certified,
it became necessary to hold three examinations
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_174' id='Page_174'>174</a></span>
before a selection was made for tobacco
examiner and two examinations before a selection
was made for tea examiner. The examinations
finally resulted in the selection of the
temporary employees, who, in the judgment of
the Commission, after careful investigation, have
no unusual qualifications for the duties to be
performed and came in at the advanced age of
sixty-three years. It seemed to the Commission
so apparent that the examinations in question
had not resulted in securing to the government
the services of the most suitable competitors,
that it became necessary for it to recommend to
the President that it be relieved of all responsibility
for these examinations and on November
18th, the President placed in the excepted class,
one examiner of tea and one examiner of tobacco
at the Port of ——, which employees
do not now have the status of competitive
employees.”</p>

<p class='c009' >It will be noted that the Civil Service Commission
itself finally recognized such a weakness
in the system that it consented and even recommended
that Treasury officials be permitted to
select <i>one</i> examiner of tea and <i>one</i> examiner of
tobacco at <i>one</i> port, though the last phrase
quoted seems to betray a slight apprehension
of disaster resulting from there being in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span>
United States two examiners, each requiring
very accurate and technical qualifications, “who
do not now have the status of competitive
employees.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Appendix “A” is limited to two letters written
by the Secretary of the Treasury to the
Civil Service Commission refusing to approve
rules and regulations which it proposed to
promulgate, unless the President so directed. I
will add that the President did not so direct.
In this instance, as in the last two, the Secretary
of the Treasury had his way.</p>

<div class='c018'>DIPLOMATIC SERVICE.</div>

<p class='c009' >While on this subject, I cannot refrain from
discussing Civil Service as applied to our diplomatic
and consular service.</p>

<p class='c009' >There is quite a widespread demand that
everything shall be taken out of politics, and a
presumption is indulged, that, if this were done,
all of the evils which now inhere in representative
government would be cured. Undoubtedly
men have been rewarded for political service
with appointments to foreign fields, and some
of these appointees have been wanting both in
business experience and education as well as in
aptitude. On the other hand, it is most unfortunate
if only those who are disqualified for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
positions of responsibility are interested in
politics. If every public position at home and
abroad were to be filled with those who either
take no interest in public affairs, or by those
who are incapable of exerting any political influence,
do you think the service would be materially
improved?</p>

<p class='c009' >The further criticism is indulged that administrations
make foreign appointments from among
their party friends, and utterly ignore adherents
of the opposite political faith. Has it ever
occurred to you that when a man is unable to
find as good and able men among those who
believe in political doctrines which he advocates
as are available among his opponents, he ought
in justice to himself to renounce allegiance to
the party he believes in, and join the ranks of
those with whom he disagrees?</p>

<p class='c009' >Undoubtedly, the United States has sent some
chumps abroad, but anyone who has lived long
in Washington must have recognized that other
countries also occasionally have chumps in their
diplomatic service. After some years’ observation,
I asked John Hay, then Secretary of
State, whose experience at home and observation
abroad better qualified him to speak than any
other man in America, how our diplomatic and
consular service compared with that of other
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_177' id='Page_177'>177</a></span>
countries. Promptly and without hesitation, he
said: “It is universally recognized everywhere
that American foreign service is the best in the
world.”</p>

<p class='c009' >One might as well expect to develop a successful
trial lawyer by confining him to a law
school all his life, or a successful business man
by keeping him indefinitely in a business college,
as to expect to produce an efficient representative
of American interests abroad by requiring
him to spend the most virile period of his life in
studying how to represent these interests and
all the while keeping him out of touch with the
interests which he is to represent. A lawyer
should understand his client’s business, if possible,
better than his client. If he is to represent
mining interests, he should know metallurgy, all
processes of mining, reduction of ores and mining
practices, as well as mining laws. Before a
man can successfully, advantageously and wisely
represent American interests abroad, he must
understand American interests at home. He
must have a practical knowledge of what Americans
require in foreign countries, and the natural
effect at home of the things he is trying to
do abroad.</p>

<p class='c009' >When confined to clerical positions, Civil
Service is a lesser evil than anything else that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_178' id='Page_178'>178</a></span>
has been tried, but it falls far short of being a
panacea. When applied to positions requiring
scientific, professional, technical or expert
knowledge, it is an utter failure. If the government
extends beyond its appropriate functions,
and enters the business arena, Civil Service will
result, first, in the greatest possible inefficiency;
second, in political manipulation and control of
everything, and, third, in transforming a hitherto
virile and self-reliant people into a race of
pap seekers. If the government pursues its
present trend and enters one field of business
activity after another it will logically end with
everyone on the government payroll and all of
us working for the rest of us and taxing ourselves
to pay pensions to ourselves. When a
government once enters the field of paternalism
there is no place where it can logically stop.</p>

  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c019'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />CIVIL SERVICE RETIREMENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>Before increasing the business activities of the
government and creating an enormous army of
government officials, clerks and employees, all
under Civil Service, it is well to consider some
feasible plan of retirement, for it is a question
that will not down.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >The discussion of Civil Service as applied to
governmental industrial operations will be incomplete
unless it includes the question of retirement.
Shall those who have been for many
years on the government payroll be pensioned?
With few exceptions that is what the present
Civil Service employees desire. They claim to
have served their country as faithfully, and
much longer, than soldiers in the army, and
therefore are entitled to equal recognition and
honor.</p>

<p class='c009' >Most thoughtful people are able to note some
marked differences. Few who are physically fit
fail when they seek admission to the army or
navy, but I have known quite a number who
have sought government positions in vain. In
addition to this the pay of the soldier is very
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_180' id='Page_180'>180</a></span>
meagre, while that of civil service clerks, in
normal times, is at least fifty per cent higher
than the same grade of service commands in the
business world. The question resolves itself
therefore into this proposition: Shall those who
have secured government positions and held
them for thirty years, when there have been
thirty thousand other citizens equally patriotic,
and equally competent, who have sought government
employment in vain, be rewarded and
pensioned because of their good fortune, and at
the expense of their less favored brothers and
sisters?</p>

<p class='c009' >The same argument applies to old age pensions.
Most red-blooded Americans are willing
to assume responsibility for the support of themselves
and their families, and gladly contribute
in some fair and equitable manner, through
appropriate processes of taxation, towards pensioning
those who bear arms in defense of our
common flag, and for the dignity of our country,
and they are also willing to pay their share
towards the maintenance of the helpless and the
unfortunate few. But it is no evidence of yellow
that some object to the burden of paying
pensions to men and women who have no other
claim thereto than that they have grown old and
have failed to provide for themselves.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>181</a></span>
Take the case home and apply it to yourself
and your family. Do you desire the government
to promise you and your children a pension independent
of the manner in which you and they
acquit yourselves? Or would you prefer to face
the future in the belief that if you win, through
merit, the rewards of victory will be yours to
enjoy, and if you lose you will be expected to
suffer the consequences. In other words do you
desire the government to pension you simply
because you hold a poor hand or play a good
hand badly? What effect do you think the
promise of old age pension would have upon the
rising generation? Is not the youth of America
already sufficiently wanting in self-reliance?</p>

<p class='c009' >The only other way thus far proposed by
which the government shall support its employees
in old age, is by means of guardianship.
This plan seems to proceed upon the theory that
those who are fortunate enough to secure government
positions, are necessarily unable to look
after their own affairs, and therefore are entitled
to a guardian. The proposition is that the government
shall take charge of a portion of the
earnings of this favored set of American citizens—withhold
part of their salary and deal it
out to them as a mother does candy to her baby
lest it overeat or consume it too soon. It is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>182</a></span>
pretty weak citizen who needs a guardian, and
those who do—provided they are <i>compos mentis</i>
and fourteen years of age—are entitled under
the laws of most states to select their own.</p>

<p class='c009' >Five years’ experience led me to recognize
that new clerks as a rule are better than old
ones. Those who come with any enthusiasm
whatever make very rapid advancement in efficiency,
but in a very few years the enthusiasm
vanishes and hope of advancement is based entirely
on seniority of service.</p>

<p class='c009' >Before leaving the Department I recommended—and
am now more convinced than ever
of its wisdom—that government positions should
be filled, as now, under the rules of Civil Service
but that all new clerks should come facing a
statute limiting the periods of their service to
five years. Five years of government service,
especially in the city of Washington, is in itself
an education. In addition there are excellent
night schools where clerks can and do pursue
their studies. Before Civil Service was inaugurated
thousands secured appointments in Washington,
graduated in law or medicine and went
forth familiar with the official atmosphere and
prepared to give the lie to those in every town
who teach that the Capitol of the Nation is a
den of thieves. John W. Gates got his start in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_183' id='Page_183'>183</a></span>
life as a sixty dollar per month clerk in the Post
Office Department and spent his evenings writing
letters for Senator John A. Logan, and
meeting the big men of the nation who called.</p>

<p class='c009' >A limited period in college is of great advantage
but it would ruin any boy to keep him
year after year in the same classes, going over
the same subjects, reciting to the same tutors,
getting nothing new and all the while segregated
from all practical things of life. Why
give these plums of official position—and they
are no less plums because secured under Civil
Service—to young men and women for life
when they might be passed around with great
advantage to that larger body of equally deserving
citizens who would be benefited by a brief
experience in public service.</p>

<p class='c009' >The present force should be permitted to complete
the tenor of their natural lives in the
service. The new rule if adopted should apply
only to those taken on after the enactment of
the law limiting the period of service to five
years. Exceptions would have to be made in
cases requiring technical, professional or scientific
knowledge. Provision would also have to
be made whereby by executive order, on the
recommendation of heads of departments, the
specially competent could be retained.</p>

  <h2 id='chXXV' class='c019'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br />PROPERTY BY COMMON CONSENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>The desire that the government shall enlarge its
functions so as to prevent large accumulations, has
led to the verge of confiscation of property.
Several proposed methods of partial or total confiscation
are discussed.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >Originally no one held property by common
consent, and in the very early history of the race
I suppose no one gave a thought to what we
now call “property rights.” Even now savages
seldom claim ownership to anything beyond a
dog, weapons of the chase, possibly a horse or a
canoe. Gradually the divinely implanted desire
for ownership, sovereignty, independence, led
the more advanced to assert exclusive rights, but
still they held little if anything by common consent.
Each held what he could by force. Under
these conditions civilization had its birth.</p>

<p class='c009' >As the race advanced and began to feel the
throb of God-like impulses, and to live in harmony
with divine law, consent to proprietorship
developed. For several centuries, in all civilized
countries, with here and there a relapse into
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_185' id='Page_185'>185</a></span>
barbarism like the French Revolution of the
18th century, and the Russian Revolution of the
20th century, property rights and some measure
of personal liberty have gone hand in hand and
have been quite generally recognized and respected.</p>

<div class='c018'>CONSENT WITHDRAWN</div>

<p class='c009' >For the first time in the history of an English
speaking people consent to personal ownership
is being gradually withdrawn. Unless you have
studied popular audiences, analyzed current
magazine articles and scrutinized modern legislation,
probably you have little conception of the
proportion, even among the respectable and high
minded, who are committed to some degree of
confiscation.</p>

<p class='c009' >At a joint debate on single tax under the
auspices of an organization like many styled
“Academy of Political Science” or “Political
Science Club” or “Science of Government
League,” which in this instance was an adjunct
of one of our very large universities, I called
for a direct expression from the audience upon
the clear-cut proposition of confiscation of all
private property. Two-thirds of the audience
promptly responded in its favor. That audience
was composed of “high-brows.” They were men
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>186</a></span>
and women who read magazines, attended lectures,
belonged to “uplift” associations and indulged
in mental processes which they thought
was thinking. I had had similar experiences in
joint debates on socialism, but had never before
struck a bunch of incipient anarchists of such
apparent respectability.</p>

<p class='c009' >Some years ago I had the privilege of addressing
an association of Socialist Clubs at
Cooper Union. While I have addressed many
better read audiences I have never seen one that
had read more. Many of them did little else
but read. In addition they were a most sincere
and good intentioned body of men and women.
There are, as every one knows who has come in
contact with them, somewhat more than fifty-seven
varieties of socialists, every one of which
was well represented that evening. They were
courteous, they were respectful, they listened
with manifest interest; but it was easily discernible
that they considered our civilization wrong
and harmful in the extreme. One could see it,
feel and taste it. The very atmosphere conveyed
to every sense the unmistakable evidence
that that great body of men and women thoroughly
believed that what they termed “Capitalism”
had its heel upon their necks. They
were not rebellious, but it was evident they did
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_187' id='Page_187'>187</a></span>
not intend anyone to be misled into supposing
that they were unconscious of their conditions,
or that they intended to acquiesce longer than
necessary.</p>

<p class='c009' >In the campaign of 1918 the “single-taxers”
of California made their third and great attempt
to confiscate land values in that beautiful state.
The issue of July 20th of “The Great Adventure,”
an official organ of the single-tax propaganda,
printed upon its front page in heavy
double leaded type this announcement: “<i>Single
tax will put these big land values into the public
treasury and leave the Ground Hogs nothing to
rent but the actual value of their buildings.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009' >The January, 1918, number of “Everyman,”
another of their official organs, contained a well-considered
article lauding conditions in Russia,
and promising the same for California. I quote
briefly: “The people of Russia, who only yesterday
were semi-starving slaves to a tinsel aristocracy,
are now for the first time living upon
their own lands, in their own homes, and working
in their own fields and factories. They have
dispossessed landlords and profiteers; and all
who work have plenty. People do not starve
where there is none to take the food out of their
mouths. Famine is a result of human exploitation.
When the people of any country go
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_188' id='Page_188'>188</a></span>
hungry it is because they are denied access to
natural resources. The people of Russia have
taken their natural resources, and also their industries
and they will not go hungry....
Out of darkest Russia has come the great light
of actual freedom; and there is every reason to
hope she will soon have the weakest government
in the world, which means, of course, the
strongest, bravest, truest and most united people....
That is what we are striving to
do in California, but we won’t stop with the land.
We will only begin there. We could not stop
there; the tide is too strong. It will bear us on
into the new world of economic friendship.”</p>

<p class='c009' >The same issue of “Everyman” gave a word
picture, for the truth of which it vouched, of
what it termed “Zapataland”—90,000 square
miles in Mexico—where it claimed confiscation
had wrought its legitimate and beneficial results.
It claimed the same conditions would be accomplished
in California through the adoption of
the single tax amendment to the Constitution
as had been wrought in Mexico with the musket.
It says: “In Zapataland they have no need for
money. Is it food you want? Go to the market
and help yourself. Do you need shoes or a hat?
Go and take what you need! Have you a fancy
for jewelry? Go make your selection....
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_189' id='Page_189'>189</a></span>
In some of the centers the women of Zapataland
clamored for finger rings and bracelets. The
elders consulted. They melted down some of
the church ornaments, and in a few months
baskets full of the envious shining trinkets were
in all the Plaza shops. Help yourself....
Labor is plentiful. Everybody wants to work
at least a few hours a day—they insist upon it.
‘Give me that shovel! You have been digging
there for a couple of hours or more. Let me dig
awhile.’ ‘Here, you, stop straining yourself.
Go and rest. I am stronger than you.’...
In Mexico, the propaganda was carried on with
‘30-30’s’. The Zapata army went from valley
to valley, from village to village, and dispossessed
the owners.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Such stuff is well calculated to deceive almost
anyone except those who have seen a Mexican.
For three successive campaigns California was
flooded with that class of literature, its boasted
purpose being confiscation. The organization
back of the propaganda, with ample endowment,
purposes to use California as an object lesson
and to extend the principle throughout the
nation.</p>

<p class='c009' >For the benefit of any who thus far have not
appreciated the gravity of this most plausible
attack upon property rights, and therefore have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_190' id='Page_190'>190</a></span>
not studied the question, I make the following
brief statement of the case as it appeals to a
very large number.</p>

<p class='c009' >Henry George, the great apostle of single
tax, was a very able man. I do not say he was a
very wise man. Great intellects frequently lead
to great errors.</p>

<p class='c009' >Every advocate of single tax legislation has
been a faithful disciple of Henry George. No
one has added a new argument, stated an old
argument with greater force, or reached a different
conclusion. None of his followers has
ever apologized for anything Henry George
ever said, or refused to stand or fall with the
great originator of the scheme. Therefore, to
quote Henry George is to quote the best authority,
and all authority.</p>

<p class='c009' >I propose, therefore, to make a few extracts
from Henry George’s standard work on the
subject—the great text book of single-taxers—“Progress
and Poverty.”</p>

<p class='c009' >He begins and ends his argument with the
proposition that God made the land, the sea,
and the air, for his children collectively, and has
never granted the exclusive right to any part
thereof to king or subject. All pretended grants
and conveyances, therefore, have been fictitious.
Relying upon this argument, he holds that all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_191' id='Page_191'>191</a></span>
natural resources still belong to the people collectively,
and confiscation in the interest of all
is justified.</p>

<p class='c025' >On page 401 of “Progress and Poverty,”
he says: “But a question of method remains.
How shall we do it? We should
satisfy the law of justice. We should meet
all economic requirements by at one stroke
abolishing all private titles, declaring all
lands public property, and letting it out to
the highest bidder in lots to suit.”</p>

<p class='c025' >On page 403 he says: “I do not propose
either to purchase, or to confiscate property
in land. The first would be unjust; the
second needless. Let the individuals who
now hold it still retain, if they want to,
possession of what they are pleased to call
their land; let them continue to call it their
land; let them buy, and sell, and bequeath
and devise it. We may safely leave them
the shell, if we take the kernel. It is not
necessary to confiscate land; it is only necessary
to confiscate rent.”</p>

<p class='c025' >Again, on the same page, he says: “We
already take some rent in taxation. We
have only to make some changes in our
mode of taxation to take it all.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_192' id='Page_192'>192</a></span>
Thus it will be seen that Henry George, with
all his intellect, was mentally dishonest. His
heart-beats were sympathetic, but his mind
wobbled. He was able to perceive nothing dishonest
when I sold my acres, or my lot, invested
the proceeds in stocks and bonds, and then by
my vote exempted my property from taxation,
and placed all the burdens of government on the
purchaser of my land.</p>

<p class='c009' >He would have seen no injustice in a government
of the people establishing Rural Credit
Banks, as has been done, loaning millions, with
mortgages as security, upon lands purchased
from the government, then inducing widows and
orphans to buy securities issued against these
mortgages, and finally taxing the value of the
real estate away, thus leaving the widows and
orphans to beg their bread from door to door.</p>

<p class='c009' >The American people are inherently and intuitively
honest and just. Do you think it
would be just, after the people, through their
Congress and their president, had granted the
homesteader a patent title in fee simple, now to
tax its value away? As Henry George says,
the effect is the same as confiscation. He calls
it “taking the kernel and leaving the shell.”</p>

  <h2 id='chXXVI' class='c019'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <br />EQUALITY OF INCOME</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>The inevitable effect of equality of income, assuming
it could be accomplished, is discussed.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >Two or three years ago George Bernard
Shaw had a prize article in the “Metropolitan”
in which he advocated “Equality of Income” as
a panacea for all the ills that afflict civilization.
I remember he urged that if all had equal incomes
the race would be improved; for there
would be greater freedom of selection. He
seemed to deplore the fact that under present
conditions “men and women meet in parks and
other public places, recognize natural affinity”
so promptly responded to by some but are nevertheless
kept apart because of this iniquitous inequality
of income. However much the man
may be attracted by the personality of the lady
he will not humble himself to make advances if
she gives evidence of being financially beneath
him; while his advances will be spurned if he
bears the marks of a more meagre income than
she enjoys.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_194' id='Page_194'>194</a></span>
It was the same old free-love doctrine, and
the author argued at length to show that inequality
of income thus seriously interferes with
the free course of “natural affinity” and hence
retards the coming of the “superman.” He did
not in that article suggest how he would equalize
incomes. Suppose we study, for a moment, not
how to accomplish it, but the effect of its consummation.</p>

<p class='c009' >If equality of income would be a panacea
now—if it would solve the ills we have and prevent
others—it would have worked well from
the beginning. Imagine therefore that instead
of following the divinely implanted impulse to
acquire, to hold, to exercise sovereignty, to
achieve, the race had remained as it was when
it had no income, and therefore when no inequality
of income existed. Would churches
and cathedrals have been built? Would colleges
and universities have been founded? Would art
and literature have flourished? Would America
have been discovered? Equality of income
would have left Queen Isabella with no jewels
to sell with which to purchase the Santa Maria.
In fact there would have been no Santa Maria
to purchase. The race would have remained
where the race started. Inequality of income
began when incomes began. Inequality of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_195' id='Page_195'>195</a></span>
income marks the birth of civilization, and if
civilization ever dies “<i>equality of income</i>” should
be the title of its dirge.</p>

<p class='c009' >The wealth of the United States is about
twenty-five hundred dollars per capita. Assume,
if you please, that all our property could be and
has been converted into cash. Then assume that
the rest of the world is able and willing to
supply our every need and our every want so
long as our money lasts! We would eat up and
wear out the accumulation of the centuries in
about three years; and henceforth would go
about clothed in skins, and our own skins at
that. The world lives from the income and
accretion resulting from the accumulations of
the ages, but in order to make it effective it
must be kept in circulation, going first to labor,
thence to the producer—the manager—by way
of the merchant, and again to labor.</p>

  <h2 id='chXXVII' class='c019'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <br />AN HISTORICAL WARNING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>The teachings of Rousseau, which logically
resulted in the French revolution, wherein the
confiscation of property was the prime purpose,
is compared with some of the teachings of today.
History that should constitute an ample warning
is cited.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >We have been sowing what Rousseau was
permitted to sow and from which was reaped
the French revolution. The “Social Contract”
taught that property as understood today did
not exist. The citizen simply held it in trust for
society. For under the “Social Contract” each
“surrenders himself up absolutely, just as he
actually stands, he and all his resources, of which
his property forms a part.” The next logical
step in the revolution was to discharge or recall
the trustee, and thus vest the property again in
society itself. That was done. George W.
Hinman in “Can We Learn Anything from
History?” summarizes this recall of trusteeships
as follows: “Society proceeded to recall its
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_197' id='Page_197'>197</a></span>
trustees as fast as ‘Society’ needed the property.
It recalled the trusteeships of all the church
property, $800,000,000; of all the property of
exiles, $600,000,000; of all the property of the
guillotined and condemned, $200,000,000; of all
the property of hospitals and charitable institutions,
$200,000,000; of all the state domains
sold and rented in the last three hundred years,
$400,000,000; of all the gold and silver vessels
and specie, $100,000,000; of all the property of
other institutions, valuables and common goods,
$700,000,000. Then it recalled the trusteeships
of coats and trousers, growing crops, pots, kettles,
pans and mattresses. In one town it recalled
the trusteeship of ten thousand pairs of
shoes from ten thousand pairs of feet, and thus
condemned ten thousand former custodians of
this property to go about their tasks barefooted
in the snow.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Not only this but the government extended
confiscation by means of income tax until the
whole of every income in excess of six hundred
dollars was to be taken. Taine, the historian,
summarizes thus: “Whatever the grand terms
of liberty, equality and fraternity may be, with
which the revolution graces itself, it is in its
essence a transfer of property. In this alone
consists its chief support, its enduring energy,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_198' id='Page_198'>198</a></span>
its primary impulse and its historical significance.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Hinman summarizes thus: “The people in a
body is infallible; unlike individuals it can make
no mistakes. Therefore we should not trust
government to individual representatives or
agents but to the pure and direct democracy.
But we cannot have direct democracy at its
purest without equality of condition. To get
equality of condition we must get equality of
property. To get equality of property we must
correct the inequalities of the past and present.
Therefore to correct these inequalities we invent
the theory of trusteeship of property, recall the
trustees, and take possession of all unequal
properties in the name of society.</p>

<p class='c009' >“That is the whole cycle; that is the great
revolution! Twenty-five years in preparation,
eleven years in actual practice, fourteen years
in immediate consequences; fifty years all told
and that is sum, substance and essence from the
beginning to the end, a transfer of property!
A transfer of property without compensation!
A confiscation of property beyond appeal and
beyond recall! There were movements also
against the church, and against the family, but
the transfer of property far surpassed them both
in size and in significance.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_199' id='Page_199'>199</a></span>
“That the convulsions attending the movement
were more spectacular than the movement itself;
that a million persons were stabbed, drowned,
shot, beheaded and hunted to death within the
borders of the nation; that wars were started
that strewed Europe with 5,000,000 dead; that
the oppression was far more ferocious than
under Louis XIV, that the waste of government
was arithmetically four times greater than under
the most wasteful monarchy; that a whole nation
was bathed in blood, bankrupted in morals, and
rotted in character to the core—all of these
things, hideous and appalling as they may be,
distracting and absorbing as they may be, are
still but as colossal incidents. <i>The chief movement
through this sea of blood and wilderness
of death was the transfer of property.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009' >Nevertheless, Robespierre—the bloodiest man
who had ever lived, the bloodiest man who ever
has lived outside of Russia, and the bloodiest
man who ever will live unless socialism gets control
in the United States—was an idealist. He
resigned the bench rather than pronounce sentence
of death upon a convicted criminal. He
read Rousseau’s “Social Contract” every day.
He was the leader in the “uplift” movement of
the age in which he lived and sought to produce
Utopian conditions of “liberty, equality and fraternity”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_200' id='Page_200'>200</a></span>
throughout France. While an Internationalist
he sought to reform and transform
France before extending his field of influence.</p>

<p class='c009' >But being self-willed as well as self-opinionated,
at the first appearance of opposition he
threw down the challenge. There was “some
fight in him and he liked it.” He appealed
directly to the people and condemned to the
guillotine everyone who had the temerity to
resist his efforts to ameliorate human conditions.
While seeking everywhere for property to confiscate,
and heads to guillotine, he made the
most elaborate speech of his career:</p>

<p class='c009' >“Our purpose is to substitute morality for
egotism, honesty for honor, principles for customs,
duties for proprieties, the empire of reason
for the tyranny of habit, contempt of vice
for indifference to misfortune, dignity for insolence,
nobility for vanity, love of glory for love
of money, good people for society, merit for
intrigue, genius for intellectual brilliancy, the
charm of contentment for the satiety of pleasure,
the majesty of man for the high breeding of the
great, a magnanimous, powerful and happy people
for amiable, frivolous and wretched people;
that is to say, every virtue and miracle of the
republic in the place of the vices and absurdities
of the monarchy.”</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_201' id='Page_201'>201</a></span>
I submit that is pretty good rhetoric and
excellent diction. Though it means absolutely
nothing it must have sounded well to the proletariat.
The people idolized Robespierre for
a while at least, as they always idolize an orator
who has great command of indefinite and high-sounding
language. Idolizing an idealist they
followed him and were led to the extremes of
democracy. The whole population of France
was transformed into an organized mob, doing
everything that a mob can do but, in the main,
preserving the forms of law.</p>

  <h2 id='chXXVIII' class='c019'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /> <br />CAPITAL AND LABOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>Among the dangers threatening the republic is
the warfare which admittedly exists between
capital and labor, the manifest tendency of which
is in the direction of bolshevism. Some citations
are made showing its imminence.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >One need not to have read the preceding
pages to know that the United States is fast
approaching a crisis. Industrial and social unrest
is everywhere apparent. Capital and labor
are at grips in many places, while management,
the all-essential factor, seems helpless to accomplish
reconciliation.</p>

<p class='c009' >When given free rein, capital enforced unbearable
terms. This resulted in legislation forbidding
combinations for the purpose of limiting
output or advancing prices of the products of
labor. Thus far labor has enjoyed express exemptions
from anti-trust laws, and it is now
making unbearable exactions. I would like to
warn labor unions that they are liable to exceed
the limits of prudence. Admittedly Congress
has the same power to forbid combinations of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_203' id='Page_203'>203</a></span>
labor as it had to prohibit combinations of capital.
Combinations of every kind are beneficial
so long as their purpose is legitimate.</p>

<p class='c009' >There is an old fable of a man who had an
ox that he worked with a donkey. One day the
ox refused to work and at night he asked the
donkey how matters had progressed without him.
“I had a very hard day, but I got through with
it,” said the donkey. “Did the boss say anything
about me?” asked the ox. “Not a word,”
said the donkey. The next night the ox again
inquired and received the same reply: “A very
hard day, but completed.” “Did the boss say
anything about me?” asked the ox. “Not a
word,” said the donkey, “but coming home he
stopped in and talked awhile with the butcher.”
It might be well for us all to understand that
if one million or ten million bankers, if one million
or ten million farmers, or if one million or
ten million organized labor men should ever attempt
to rule America in the interest of any one
class, and should assume to dictate the terms on
which production can be continued, it will be
only a question of time when one hemisphere
will be freed from organized coercion. But
every organization of labor, every combination
of capital, and every association of farmers,
might be dissolved and it would not more than
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_204' id='Page_204'>204</a></span>
temporarily relieve the situation. It is a condition
that confronts us and no amount of
theorizing will improve it.</p>

<p class='c009' >Recently an official of the Department of
Labor, in a carefully prepared article, made
the profound declaration that warfare between
capital and labor will continue until justice is
assured. Grant, if you please, that a court of
exact justice could be created, with a judge
wiser than Solomon on the bench. Its decisions
would satisfy neither capital nor labor. Arbitration
boards occasionally seek to do exact justice.
They usually ignore that element and aim
simply to effect a workable compromise, that
will temporarily save the situation. When the
terms are accepted and acquiesced in, both sides
profess to be satisfied, but neither side is satisfied.
Capital thinks it is entitled to everything
because without capital labor would starve, and
it demands that labor remove its shoes from off
its feet in its presence. Labor thinks <i>it</i> is entitled
to everything because without labor capital
would languish. It goes further and declares
capital to be a myth. It says that all so-called
wealth is the product of labor; and if labor had
not been robbed there would be no accumulated
wealth—and all such socialistic and anarchistic
nonsense which emanates largely from German-bred
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_205' id='Page_205'>205</a></span>
or German-educated teachers of political
economy and sociology, emphasized by a large
number of public speakers both within and without
the church, and by demagogues generally.
Hence “labor claims the full proceeds of its
service less enough to keep the tools and machinery
in repair.” It asks that capital remove
its shoes. Both capital and labor ignore the
most important factor of production—management.</p>

<p class='c009' >A century and more of matchless development,
wherein money getting had been the chief
aim of life, especially with those possessing aptitude
and enough energy to pay the price of
achievement, divided the people into classes.
Those possessing aptitude for acquisition won
wealth, those with aptitude for discovery won
distinction, those possessing aptitude for statesmanship,
or for war, won fame. Many of those
who won wealth became arrogant, overbearing,
snobbish and some of them despisedly mean.
Logically—for everything in this world proceeds
from cause to effect—those who did not possess
the particular type of aptitude necessary for
acquisition, together with those who were unwilling
to pay the price, denounced riches and
the possessors thereof. Some of these became
envious, threatening, even rebellious, and not a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_206' id='Page_206'>206</a></span>
few despisedly mean. The result is a different
America than the one our fathers knew, and it
does not require an old fogy to see it. A man
is not a pessimist simply because he recognizes
self-evident facts. Noah came far nearer being
a statesman than a pessimist. History simply
repeats itself. Macauley, singing of the “brave
days of old,” says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c024'   >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Then none was for a party,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then all were for the State,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then the rich man helped the poor</div>
      <div class='line'>And the poor man loved the great.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009' >Now the poor man first envies the rich man
and then hates him, the rich man hates the richer,
and the richer snubs the would-be rich. As a
matter of fact, there was never as much sympathy
for the poor as now, never as much being
done for him as at present. But sympathy and
charity are not what he needs, as I hope to be
able to show.</p>

<div class='c018'>IS THE SITUATION HOPELESS?</div>

<p class='c009' >If the human race has reached a condition
where further progress is impossible, and nothing
but class antagonisms are left, it would seem
that a second occasion has arisen when Jehovah
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_207' id='Page_207'>207</a></span>
might “repent that he had made man.” Patriotism
demands a solution, without which no sane
man dares hope for anything except what the
socialist predicts in language more ominous than
any direct threat.</p>

<p class='c009' >Permit a few excerpts from a chapter, “The
Revolution,” added by its author to a pamphlet
containing a debate on socialism, and which he
used extensively in his campaign for Congress
in 1916. The author is a man of excellent presence
and seeming patriotism. I believe him to
be as sincere in his belief as any evangelist of
the olden times. He commends the vision of
Ignatius Donneley in prophesying the approaching
cataclysm: “The people cannot comprehend
it. They look around for their defenders—the
police, the soldier, where are they? Will not
this dreadful nightmare pass away? No, never!
This is the culmination—this is the climax, the
century’s aloe blooms today.” He adds: “These
are the grapes of wrath which God has stored
up for the day of His vengeance; and now He
is tramping them out and this is the red juice—look
you—that flows so thick and fast in the
very gutters.... Evil has but one child—<span class='sc'>DEATH</span>.
For years you have nourished and nurtured
evil. Do you complain if her monstrous
progeny is here, with sword and torch? What
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_208' id='Page_208'>208</a></span>
else did you expect? Did you think she would
breed angels?” And then after explaining that
he does not speak “these bitter words in the
spirit of a challenge, but with the kindliest, deepest
feeling of love for all humanity, and with
the most fervent and patriotic feelings of veneration
for my country—the grandest country in
the world, but now being systematically robbed,”
he warns “the masters of the bread” thus: “I
warn them that if they want ‘red hell’ with all
the accompanying fireworks—with all the attendant
brutality, and crime, and suffering, and
misery, and degradation, and sorrow and death,
with the destruction of their cities and the wiping
out of their so-called civilization, they can
have it just when they most desire. It is up to
them. The revolutions of the past will be but
kindergarten affairs compared to the revolution
now pending and coming when some one strikes
a match in the powder house.”</p>

  <h2 id='chXXIX' class='c019'>CHAPTER XXIX<br /> <br />CAN THE CRISIS BE AVERTED?</h2>
</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>Our troubles have all resulted from false
teachings which are leading us farther and
farther afield. The very rich will spend nothing
to correct the public mind and legislation seems
powerless to afford a remedy.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >All this might have been prevented and possibly
even now can be avoided. It has been
brought upon us in part by false education but
largely through evolution in our form of government,
in our purpose of government, and in
industrial conditions. It could have been prevented
by correct education both inside and outside
the schoolroom. It may possibly be avoided
by a speedy return to fundamental Americanism.
But whatever happens, no citizen can
boast of patriotism until he has sought a remedy;
and no one is a patriot who will not sacrifice
everything to save the situation.</p>

<p class='c009' >In this connection let me warn you not to
expect any considerable portion of the necessary
work to be done by the very rich. They have
so long believed, and their experience has justified
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_210' id='Page_210'>210</a></span>
the conviction that money will buy anything,
that many of them seem to think their
wealth will enable them to buy liberty of a mob.
A mob is always venal but it can never be bribed
by what it has the power to take. Did the
wealthy of France escape? They were the first
to die. Have the rich of Russia been spared?
They have been the first to suffer. Possibly the
rich may be able to buy their choice of being
mutilated before or after death. The history of
all revolutions of the kind that seems impending
justifies the prediction that the more money a
man has the greater certainty of his torture and
ultimate death. Quite recently a very rich man
was asked to contribute to a campaign of education
against bolshevism. He wrote a patronizing
letter acknowledging the importance of the
work, but expressed the opinion that it should
be financed, not by the rich, but by men worth
thirty or forty thousand dollars. “Accursed be
the gold that gilds the narrow forehead of the
fool.”</p>

<div class='c018'>LEGISLATION OFFERS NO REMEDY</div>

<p class='c009' >It is recorded that the children of Israel once
upon a time got into serious difficulty through
worshipping a golden calf while Moses was on
the mountain getting the Moral Law. If
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_211' id='Page_211'>211</a></span>
American civilization is idolatrous—and it seems
not to be free from that sin—the object of its
worship is statute law, to the neglect of underlying
principles which make most laws unnecessary.
In the last ten years over sixty-five
thousand statutes have been enacted by Congress
and the state legislatures and approved by executives.
Meanwhile the evil we are now considering,
in common with most others recognized
a decade ago, has in the main increased. Neither
the laws of nature, nor the laws of economics,
nor the laws of society, can be reversed by
statute. We have proceeded upon the theory
that a republic can accomplish anything by
popular edict, but the tides come in whether prohibited
by sovereign king or by sovereign people.</p>

<div class='c018'>A DIAGNOSIS</div>

<p class='c009' >Before a disease can be treated with any hope
of success, its cause, no less than its manifestations,
must be studied. American industries
and internal improvements were begun with
American labor. I can remember when girls
in northern New England spent their winters
in the factories at Lowell and Manchester and
returned to teach school during the summer.
When our industries outgrew the supply of
American labor, agents were sent abroad and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_212' id='Page_212'>212</a></span>
immigrants were brought over under contract.
When Congress forbade the admission of contract
labor, and wages still advanced, the world
heard of it and a polyglot mass of all kindreds
and tribes and complexions came flocking to our
shores, because, as we have seen elsewhere in
this volume, labor was better rewarded here than
elsewhere, and relatively better rewarded than
capital. Naturally, American-bred boys and
girls did not fancy working side by side with
foreigners who did not speak the English language,
who had not imbibed American ideas
and were strangers to American standards of
living. So they ceased to accept work, and commenced
looking for situations.</p>

<p class='c009' >I visited a mill in Passaic, New Jersey, where
the rules were posted in five languages, and a
teacher in one of the schools told me there were
nineteen languages spoken in her room. In
thousands of establishments, laborers, many of
whose names are unpronounceable, are known
by numbers. Think of an American citizen,
outside of a penitentiary, being identified and
known by number. Will any wage satisfy that
man? What wage or salary will you accept
and be known to your boss only by number,
and stand in line and accept a pay envelope
at the end of the week as “437”? An increased
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_213' id='Page_213'>213</a></span>
wage may temporarily satisfy the intellect of a
man thus environed but it will not satisfy his
heart hunger.</p>

<p class='c009' >There are only two demands that a laborer
knows how to make: He can ask shorter hours,
and he can demand more wages, but neither
will satisfy, for neither is the thing he needs.
Would you like to know what it is for which
the very soul of every man—laborer no less than
capitalist—cries and without which he will not
be appeased? You do not need to be told. You
have only to hark back to the days of your
youth. You have only to study mental philosophy,
using your own inner consciousness as
a text book, and you will find the answer.
What the American laborer demands, what the
American citizen, regardless of his surroundings,
needs, is recognition. He wants a voice. His
very being demands some measure of responsibility.
He needs to feel that in some way he
has contributed to results and that someone besides
himself knows it. God save America from
a generation in whom these divinely implanted
aspirations have been stifled.</p>

<p class='c009' >Being unable to formulate these longings, the
laborer limits his demands to the two things
which the walking delegate tells him are the
only things necessary—shorter hours and more
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_214' id='Page_214'>214</a></span>
pay. When he gets them the real need of his
being remains untouched and he repeats his demand.
When his employer seeks to do something
for him, instead of <i>doing something together
with him</i>, he resents both his charity and
his sympathy, and spurns his advice.</p>

<p class='c009' >Men who are required to deal with men ought
to give primary study to human nature, and
omit the study of angelic nature until they join
the angels. Suppose we continue this analysis
of human nature for therein we may find the
seed of truth that shall, if nurtured, fructify in
blessing to us all.</p>

<p class='c009' >A few years ago the Chamber of Commerce
of one of our very large cities gave a Lincoln
Day Banquet at which the speaker of the House
of Representatives of Congress was the guest of
honor. Among other wise philosophies that fell
from his lips was this: “I do not know your
personal genesis but I will guess that less than
fifty years ago nine out of ten of the intelligent,
virile leaders of production, who own and represent
capital, as well as the high officials of your
state, and of the nation, who sit at this table,
were bright-faced schoolboys in the common
schools, ‘building castles in Spain.’ If this
Chamber shall repeat this banquet a half century
hence, you can find your successors in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_215' id='Page_215'>215</a></span>
public schools of today ‘building castles in
Spain.’” The thought I gather is not the trite
expression that “The youth of today is the adult
of tomorrow,” nor that the public school is the
nursery of greatness. The thought I get is that
he who is destined to achieve prominence in any
walk of life is the youth who “builds castles in
Spain,” who imagines, who hopes, and who goes
out to fight for the fulfillment of his dreams.</p>

<p class='c009' >What is the probability of a man who cannot
speak the English language, and who receives
nothing more tangible than a pay envelope and
its contents, handed to him by number, sitting
by the cot of his son and inspiring the imagination
of the coming American? If he says anything,
is he not likely to say—are there not a
million homes where this is the only appropriate
thing that can be said: “My boy, I am sorry
that I brought you into the world. I see nothing
in life for you. The future is not only
dumb but awful dark.”</p>

<p class='c009' >The kind of men who made this country were
told a different story at their trundle beds. They
were inspired with hope, for their parents were
full of hope. They were filled with expectation,
for they knew their parents were expectant. If
we revive contented, hopeful Americanism we
must inspire “castle building.” We must fill the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_216' id='Page_216'>216</a></span>
youth with hope and whet his imagination to
keenest edge until he will intuitively seek literature
instead of twaddle with which to express
his aspiration.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016' ><span class='small'>While democracy as a form of government spells
ruin, democracy in society spells America in her
best estate. The possibility of industrial republics
is suggested.</span></p>

<p class='c017' >While talking about democracy in government
we seem to have lost our conception of
democracy in society. What better can we
expect from democracy in government than
France’s experience, when the voice of the people
was declared to be the voice of God? But
social democracy is a very different thing from
a democratic form of government, and has well
nigh become a lost blessing.</p>

<p class='c009' >When the socialist talks about “Industrial
Democracy” he means a democratic form of
government, with all industries under popular
management. That is one extreme. The capitalist
demands industrial autocracy. That is the
other extreme.</p>

<p class='c009' >In a previous chapter I have tried to show
that when the Fathers formed this government,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_218' id='Page_218'>218</a></span>
their experiences, as well as their knowledge of
history led them to fear the monarch. The
French Revolution was about to burst into
what its promoters promised should be the
purest form of democracy which the world had
ever seen, and the Fathers were justly apprehensive.
Dreading the mass quite as much as
they feared the monarch, they chose the middle
course. They chose representative government.</p>

<p class='c009' >I wonder if there be a middle course between
industrial autocracy and industrial democracy.
Is it possible for business concerns and manufacturing
plants to create within their organizations
industrial republics where each employee
shall have some actual voice, and through their
representatives sitting in deliberative bodies,
analogous to our legislative branch, originate
and recommend or approve reforms and improvements
subject, of course, to a veto by a
cabinet?</p>

<p class='c009' >Many methods of profit sharing have been
tried and they have usually worked advantageously,
but admittedly they fall far short of the
requirements. So-called cooperative industrial
concerns have been created with some measure
of success, yet the real problem remains untouched
and as complex as ever. Labor has
never established a cooperative industry worthy
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_219' id='Page_219'>219</a></span>
of the name, except as Mallock shows in “The
Limits of Pure Democracy,”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c020'><sup>[3]</sup></a> when the actual
operation of the concern has been placed in the
hands of an oligarch whose administration is as
arbitrary as that of any captain of industry.
Only in that way has it been possible to supply
management, the most essential element, as we
have seen, in any enterprise. Labor has sometimes
found the capital, but capital and labor
without management are impotent. A goodly
number of corporations have encouraged and
even assisted their workmen to buy stock, which
is a very good and meritorious policy. It may
tend to alleviate but it fails to cure.</p>

<p class='c009' >Mallock clearly shows that every successful
government unites the elements of autocracy and
democracy. Even the Imperial German Government
granted certain powers to the people,
while the Constitution of the United States
clothes the president with powers in certain respects
rivaling those of the kaiser. The power
of veto which the Constitution vests in the president
exceeds any prerogative possessed by the
king of England. On the other hand the power
to make war rests with Congress, while in Great
Britain it requires no parliamentary act. Mallock
enlarges upon this thought and shows that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_220' id='Page_220'>220</a></span>
socialist organizations and labor unions are successful
only because they are arbitrarily managed.
Their so-called leaders are, in fact, oligarchs.
The Russian Revolution, like the French
Revolution, was avowedly of democratic origin,
but in fact both were as despotic as anything
the world has ever seen. The strength and
grandeur of the government of the United
States, as established by the Constitution, lies in
the most happy combination and blending of
these two fundamental principles, popular sovereignty
and centralized strength.</p>

<p class='c009' >The primary difficulty in solving the so-called
labor question lies, I think, in failing to recognize
the individuality—the personality of the
employee. Some tiny share of profits is offered
in lieu of increased wages and it is accepted as
a mere sop. The offer of stock at a price below
the market, with easy payments, is looked upon
as a cheap way of tying the hands of the employee,
and as an insurance against strikes. I
think I am safe in saying that in a very large
majority of cases where any of these methods
have been tried the men have resented them, and
in some instances spurned them. Then the employer
concludes that labor will not accept decent
treatment, closes his ears, his mouth and
his heart and proceeds to get all he can and to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_221' id='Page_221'>221</a></span>
give as little as can possibly be forced out of
him.</p>

<p class='c009' >If the basis of masculine happiness is, as I
have tried to show, the divinely implanted desire
for creatorship, sovereignty and achievement,
then we will find it impossible to satisfy the subconscious
longings of the human heart with
shorter hours, increased wages, or with some
slight share of profits in lieu of increased wages.
If I am right in my analysis the pathway of
access to the real man in the overalls—and a real
man is in the overalls and must be discovered—is
by some scheme that will necessarily recognize
him as a real, thinking and potential entity.</p>

<p class='c009' >Most humans prefer to be called “citizens”
rather than “subjects.” Autocrats speak of their
subjects. In republics there are no subjects.
All are fellow citizens. If this thought can be
carried into the industrial world, the “citizens”
therein will find their heart hunger appeased,
their hope inspired and they will lift their heads
into the clearer atmosphere of industrial opportunity,
and possibility of ultimate social recognition.
If the theory of evolution has any foundation
in fact the species began to lift its head
with the first impulse of hope, and its whole
body stood erect when the consciousness dawned
of being human. A free, brave and hopeful
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_222' id='Page_222'>222</a></span>
people never went mad. Desperation and failure
of recognition is the parent of revolution.
Most anyone will fight when called “it.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Pardon a little personal observation which has
direct bearing upon increased efficiency resulting
from no other cause than recognition and
hope. Forty years ago immigrants from both
Germany and Sweden came from Castle Garden
to my town every few days. They had been
born “subjects” and they toiled after their arrival
as they had toiled before as “subjects.” They
moved with the air of “subjects.” In my imagination
I can see those German families coming
up the middle of the street in wooden shoes,
single file, the man ahead empty handed except
his long pipe, the wife close behind with a baby
in her arm, and a big bundle on her head, and
the children in regular succession according to
age, which seldom varied more than two years.
There must have been some hope in the man’s
heart or he would not have left his native country.
But neither his gait nor his other movements
betrayed it. These immigrants immediately
sought and secured employment, but they
were not worth much the first month or so. It
did not take long, however, until it would dawn
upon them that opportunity had actually
knocked at their door. A few Sunday afternoons
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_223' id='Page_223'>223</a></span>
on the porch of friends who had left the
Fatherland as poor as they, and who were now
comfortably situated, plus a wage scale of which
hitherto they had only been told, transformed
those big fellows. I am not exaggerating when
I say they would do without urging from fifty
to one hundred percent more work six months,
and often six weeks, after their arrival than
when they came. They had begun “building
castles in Spain.” They were dreaming dreams
and the central figure in every vision was a home
of their own, and personal recognition. Instead
of being subjects they had determined to become
citizens.</p>

<p class='c009' >Can this transformation still be wrought? If
it can all danger is past. Of one thing I am
certain. It cannot be done by legislation.</p>

  <h2 id='concl' class='c019'>CONCLUSION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017' >I came to man’s estate thoroughly believing
that the Constitution of the United States is
the greatest chart of liberty ever penned by man;
and nothing that I have seen, nothing that I
have heard, and nothing that has transpired in
all my mature life has shaken my faith.</p>

<p class='c009' >I think I must have been born an optimist.
From earliest recollection I have liked the
rooster that crows in the morning better than
the owl that hoots in the nighttime. And what
is best of all, the surroundings of my childhood
and youth were exceedingly hopeful. I have
seen few hours of discouragement and none of
despondency. Despising the pessimist, I have
resolved, and am resolved, that nothing shall
dim my hope or weaken my confidence either in
my country or in the American people, and yet
in spite of myself I sometimes feel a very unwelcome
impulse.</p>

<p class='c009' >I observe the teachings of Jefferson forsaken
and instead of the minimum of government
and the maximum of liberty, more and more
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_225' id='Page_225'>225</a></span>
of government and less and less of liberty. I
see ignored the warnings of Washington against
weakening the energy of our governmental system
by making changes in the Constitution. I
mark the trend away from representative government
towards direct government, a policy
that has wrought ruin whenever and wherever it
has been tried. I note the growing disrespect
for authority in the home, in the school and on
the street, coupled with certain slurs at the forms
of law, as well as for judgments and decrees
rendered in harmony therewith, emphasized by
bald and naked threats to undermine and, if
possible, overthrow our entire judicial system.
I overhear the subtle suggestion to our youth
that they need give no thought for the morrow,
for the government will soon insure employment;
that it is folly to make themselves efficient,
for the government will sooner or later
guarantee wages regardless of merit; that they
need not practice thrift, for the government will
ultimately pension their old age regardless of
profligate habits or vicious living. I discover a
growing recognition of capitalistic, industrial
and even servant classes, with attempts at class
legislation, all subversive of republican ideas,
republican traditions and republican institutions.
When I realize that all this is as yet only a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_226' id='Page_226'>226</a></span>
verdant growth from socialistic, not to say anarchistic
seed sown broadcast with scarcely a protest,
and knowing that a harvest must yet be
garnered, I am at times apprehensive.</p>

<p class='c009' >But I am reminded that this is the people’s
government. If they want it this way it is
their business and not mine. If they make a
mistake they are abundantly able to respond in
consequences. All of which is true, but the fact
that it is true, and awfully true, only emphasizes
the importance of alert men in the watch towers.</p>

<p class='c009' >Recognizing the existence of the greatest
crisis of all time, a crisis wherein all that we call
Christian civilization is imperiled, and being unable
to hold my peace I have produced what I
hope shall be considered an argument. I have
tried to prove scientifically that the fathers were
wise beyond their generation. Nothing is scientific
that will not stand the test of application.
I consider the unschooled George Stevenson a
scientist of the first order. He thought out, and
worked out, a safety lamp for the protection of
coal miners, who during every hour of their toil
stood in imminent danger of explosions. Then
to prove that he was scientifically correct he had
himself lowered into the mine in the nighttime,
and, standing there alone, thrust his lighted
lamp into the escaping gas. The achievements
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_227' id='Page_227'>227</a></span>
of the past afford proof positive that our form
of government, our policy and our purpose of
government were scientifically correct. It cannot
be exploded or overthrown. Its only danger
is from those of its own household, the children
of its own institutions, who may undermine it.</p>

<p class='c009' >Even the most casual reader must have discovered
that in a very marked degree we have
departed from the teachings of the Fathers.
This we have done first in our form of government,
and secondly in our purpose of government,
both of which tend strongly to bolshevism,
sometimes called socialism, and sometimes called
“pure democracy.” It might as well be called
Rousseauism. The name is immaterial. The
thing itself is the same old snake that first
charms, then strangles, covers its victim with
ooze and swallows at leisure.</p>

<p class='c009' >There is little in the book except what the
writer considers has direct bearing upon one or
the other of two major proposition. First:
Representative government was the correct
principle when established, and therefore is correct
now and will be correct to the end of time.
Second: The government was originally correct
in granting liberty of action to the citizens and
in limiting its own activities to strictly governmental
functions. Third: Each and every departure
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_228' id='Page_228'>228</a></span>
from correct principles or wise policies
has led by one pathway or another in the direction
of bolshevism.</p>

<p class='c009' >No people will ever outgrow correct principles
of government any more than they will
correct principles of agriculture. The fact that
times have changed, that inventions have revolutionized
industry and that improved methods
of transportation have annihilated space, do not
in the slightest degree make erroneous a correct
principle of government any more than they
render false a principle of nature. If the law
of gravitation were a provision of the Federal
Constitution, there were many in the United
States who would have sought to amend it when
the “Titanic” went down. They would have
argued that when the principle was promulgated
by the Great Law Giver, there were neither icebergs
nor steamships.</p>

<p class='c009' >The argument that the people are wiser now
than they were is false. The Constitutional
Convention contained a larger proportion of
college graduates than any convention that has
since assembled anywhere, and some of the
wisest, and safest and most experienced were
not college men. The people who came to
America prior to 1787 came for motives as
lofty as have actuated those of recent years,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_229' id='Page_229'>229</a></span>
and in character, breadth of purpose and intelligence
they compare favorably with immigrants
of today. In addition, they had many advantages
which we do not possess. They had time
to think, the prime essential of greatness. They
had neither the inclination nor the opportunity
to read news items from all over the globe in
three or four editions of a metropolitan newspaper,
which professedly prints only news, but
prints it several times each day. Meditation is
necessary for a statesman whether he be required
to discharge his responsibility in the halls of
legislation or permitted to do so at the polls.</p>

<p class='c009' >In defending our form of government, I have
submitted a brief argument for an independent
judiciary. This should be unnecessary in any
country enjoying and professing adherence to
Anglican liberty. In justification I plead the
growing disrespect for, and the multiplied attacks
upon, our whole judicial system.</p>

<p class='c009' >I have also sought to show by the record, as
well as by some reference and analysis of human
aspirations and emotions, that the governmental
policy pursued for many years was correct, and
therefore is and will be correct forever. If I
have failed to make it clear that for more than
one hundred years the government fostered
every industry and fathered none, I have made
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_230' id='Page_230'>230</a></span>
poor use of the material at hand. I have sought
to show that the government merely safeguarded
the liberties of the people, while her citizens pursued
their happiness and won it in achievement,
which, in regular sequence, made the nation
great. If the argument has any force, it should
lead irresistibly to the conclusion that if America
expects to make further advancement, the only
sure way is to return to these fundamental
principles.</p>

<p class='c009' >I have referred to and briefly discussed bolshevist
or socialist doctrines, including confiscation
of property, only because they are all involved
in the departure from the policy of the
fathers. When the Republic changed its course
little by little away from granting liberty and
affording opportunity and began to restrict and
to absorb what the citizen had formerly enjoyed,
the way was opened for all the elements of
revolution. To understand the gravity of the
situation one must study the logical effect, and
to comprehend the effect some reference to similar
movements in France and Russia is necessary.</p>

<p class='c009' >I have sought to strengthen the argument
against governmental interference in purely
secular affairs by showing the unavoidable handicap
the government is under when it enters the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_231' id='Page_231'>231</a></span>
field of business. This has occasioned some analysis
of the Civil Service system, with illustrations
of its actual operations.</p>

<p class='c009' >That my country will return to its original
form and purpose, I am more than hopeful;
yea, I am confident. It must be that the United
States will revert to representative government
in its original simplicity. It cannot be otherwise
than that a wise citizenship will again select
their representatives because of aptitude and will
retain them in positions of responsibility until
they shall have acquired efficiency through experience,
gauging their worth, the while, by results
rather than by subservient obedience. An ambitious
people, resourceful and hopeful, virile and
expectant will certainly take their government
out of business, and confine its operations to the
legitimate functions of government. All the
traditions of the past, all the teachings of the
Fathers, all the warnings of history are against
paternalism. No government ever made or will
make a people great except as it guarantees
liberty whereby the people shall make themselves
great. No people ever have made or will
make themselves great by relying upon their
government to do for them the things which the
Almighty intended—yea decreed—that they
should do for themselves.</p>

<p class='c009' >To Civil Service Commission:</p>

<p class='c009' >Your letter of November 4th relative to the
adoption of rules governing the employment of
laborers in the Federal Service at Boston is at
hand. I will have occasion to take the matter up
with the President, and if he desires the rules
signed I shall be glad to comply. Otherwise I
shall decline.</p>

<p class='c009' >My principal objection is the fact that paragraph
6, “Definition of Classified Work,” contained
in the regulations governing the employment
of classified laborers, adopted July 23,
1903, has proved very impracticable. In fact
that Department not only violates these rules
every day, but ignores them and is compelled to
do so. I am also advised that the Civil Service
Commission not only violates them, but ignores
them. I respect the Commission for doing this,
and my respect would not be diminished if it
would repeal such regulations as have to be ignored
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_233' id='Page_233'>233</a></span>
by the very men who promulgate them.
The fact that they are thus ignored by the Civil
Service Commission is supported by the clear
and repeated statement of a member of the
Commission, made in my office.</p>

<p class='c009' >And this is not all. It is well nigh impossible
to secure from the skilled laborer register of the
Commission persons who are willing to perform
the menial service which is required of unskilled
laborers. The rule referred to forbids our taking
unskilled laborers from our payroll to perform
this menial service, and permit them incidentally
to perform service that requires a
knowledge of reading and writing. We are now
in the midst of a prolonged correspondence with
the Civil Service Commission over a case arising
at San Francisco where the offense was that an
unskilled laborer, assigned to handle merchandise,
was permitted to go to a pile of bales and
boxes on the docks and select a package that was
needed for examination, and exercised his ability
to read the number on the package. Had some
skilled laborer gone with the unskilled laborer,
to read the number, and had then informed the
unskilled laborer that that package bore the
desired number, all would have been well. Under
the rules for which you are contending it
requires two men to get a package, when either
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_234' id='Page_234'>234</a></span>
one can get it alone, and then it takes a man and
a stenographer in this office to conduct the correspondence
that grows out of the offense of
allowing either one to do it unaided by the other.
If the President wants this condition inaugurated
at Boston and other ports, as well as at
San Francisco, I shall be very glad to see that
it is done.</p>

<p class='c009' >I will be very glad to co-operate with the Civil
Service Commission to improve the service in
this Department, not only in Boston but in every
port. I am a firm believer in Civil Service, and,
I may add, in the machinery of Civil Service
but I am more interested in improving the product
than in perfecting the machine. So far as
I am concerned I will not voluntarily sign and
promulgate rules for the mere sake of signing
and promulgating rules. I will co-operate to
the fullest extent in anything that will improve
the service.</p>

<p class='c009' >To the Civil Service Commission:</p>

<p class='c009' >Your letter of the 14th inst, submitting for
approval a statement of physical requirements
for male unskilled laborers is received.</p>

<p class='c009' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_235' id='Page_235'>235</a></span>
I am unalterably opposed to a graduated scale
of physical ability. If a man of medium weight,
130 lbs., and minimum height, 5 ft. 3 in., and
with strength to carry a minimum weight, 150
lbs., is to be marked 70, as you propose, then a
man weighing 200 lbs., 6 ft. tall, and able to
carry 200 lbs., would I supposed be marked 80;
and a man weighing 300 lbs., 6 ft. 5 in. in height,
and able to carry 500 lbs., should be marked 100.
No one would have such a man around. He
would be physically incompetent. Either a man
is physically competent or he is not. Most of
the defects referred to as sufficient to justify
rejection are all right. I have no objection to a
list of competents being made and from that
list we will select. But I would rather base my
judgment upon the appearance of an applicant
who would come into the office and say “good
morning” and retire than all the physical examinations
that the Civil Service Commission can
give.</p>

<p class='c009' >I do not care to prolong the correspondence;
I simply will not consent to accept unskilled
laborers on a graduated scale of physical ability.
I do not care whether a man can lift 150 lbs. or
400 lbs. when there be only 10 lbs. to lift.</p>

November 21st certifying three names from
which to select a Tea Examiner.</p>

<p class='c009' >I hereby file objection to each and all of the
persons so certified because of mental unfitness
for the position for which they apply.</p>

<p class='c009' >There is no tariff duty on tea and the sole
purpose of examination of tea is to protect the
American people from cheap and deleterious
preparations. A competent tea examiner must
be able to pour hot water on a sample of tea
and by tasting, tell within five cents per pound
of what it is worth, and to determine accurately
whether the sample is composed of tea or of
some imitation or preparation thereof, and
whether it has been adulterated. Whether he
can speak the English language or sign his name
is immaterial. If he knows tea, and is honest
and incorruptible, the American people will get
protection. These men know no more about tea
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_237' id='Page_237'>237</a></span>
than you or I and they are as unfit for the place
as either of us.</p>

<p class='c009' >In proof of the foregoing, one of the names
certified is that of a clerk in the Customs Service
and is known to this Department to be wholly
unfit for Tea Examiner. He is a clerk and
not a Tea Expert.</p>

<p class='c009' >Another is a bookkeeper, and has been continuously
thus employed since 1886, and knows
nothing about tea and does not pretend to.</p>

<p class='c009' >The third is now an opener and packer in the
Customs Service and admits that all he knows
about tea is the fact that he once sold coffee.
The serious side of this matter is the absolute
and literal truth of the foregoing.</p>

<p class='c009' >Some conception of the importance of the
position may be gained from the fact that over
three hundred packages of alleged tea have been
excluded in the last ninety days at that port
alone.</p>

This is sufficient to show the importance of
the position and the necessity of having an
expert tobacco man as examiner. No one of
these certified is competent. The first is a clerk
and stenographer. He has been a letter carrier
and is now a clerk in the Customs House at
$1,200.00 per annum. He is a professional Civil
Service Examination taker, and admits having
“crammed” as he terms it for this examination.
He has never had anything to do with the
tobacco business except that he was once stenographer
to a tobacco merchant.</p>

<p class='c009' >The second is a storekeeper and clerk in the
Customs Service. He has had no experience
whatever in tobacco except to have seen bales of
tobacco while storekeeper for the government.</p>

<p class='c009' >The third has been a cigar maker but does
not pretend to know anything about the tobacco
business except a little experience in making
cigars from tobacco purchased by others, and
that in a very small way. He is in my judgment
wholly unprepared to protect the revenues
of the government against the frauds continually
attempted by unscrupulous importers, who
pursue the line of least resistance, and bring
their tobacco to the port where deception is least
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_240' id='Page_240'>240</a></span>
likely to be detected. He is equally unprepared
to protect the honest importer from competition
with the unscrupulous.</p>

<p class='c009' >In kindness but in honesty let me say that the
man who conducted the examinations has no conception
whatever of the qualifications needed in
a tobacco examiner.... These applicants
may be nice men, and they may wear good
clothes, and they may speak good English, and
may be men of integrity, but no one of them is
fit to hold the very important position to which
he aspires, and for the simple reason that he
knows nothing at all about the only thing he
needs to know anything about, to-wit: Tobacco!</p>

<p class='c009' >To the Civil Service Commission:</p>

<p class='c009' >Gentlemen:</p>

<p class='c009' >I wish you would hold an examination for
special agents at the earliest possible moment.
As I explained to your Mr. —— the other
day, the Department needs some special agents
with legal training. Not all special agents need
legal training, but there are many times when
cases have to be prepared for presentation to
the Board of General Appraisers, or to the
Court, where legal experience is almost essential.
I will give you an illustration: Not long
ago I needed to send a man to Europe to investigate
alleged undervaluations in crockery and
chinaware. I had the matter investigated by
three special agents and special employees with
no satisfactory results. They did not know what
was essential, and did not seem to know evidence
when they saw it. I then appointed an experienced
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_242' id='Page_242'>242</a></span>
lawyer as special employee and sent him
over. The evidence he collected ought to secure
a fifty percent advance on these goods.</p>

<p class='c009' >I want to urge that in this instance you prepare
the questions so as to exclude everyone who
is not an experienced lawyer. I also desire to
see the questions before the examination is held.
I want to cooperate with the Commission, and I
urge the Commission to cooperate with me in
getting material absolutely necessary to good
administration.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009' >Sir:</p>

<p class='c009' >Referring to the examination for special
treasury agents which you desire this Commission
to hold and with respect to which you
make oral inquiry today, the Commission has
the honor to state that the questions on government,
law, and customs matters prepared by
your Department have been given careful consideration.
It is the opinion of the Commission
that the questions are of such a character that
they might be answered by a person without
testing his qualifications for the position of Special
Treasury Agents, and that, on the other
hand, failure to answer the questions would not
indicate lack of qualification for such position.</p>

<p class='c009' >The Commission is sincerely desirous of co-operating
with your Department in securing
competent persons for the service, but it does
not believe that an examination along the lines
indicated in the material submitted by your Department
would have the desired effect.</p>

<p class='c009' >The Commission very seriously doubts whether
the position of Special Agent can be filled as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_244' id='Page_244'>244</a></span>
satisfactorily by open competitive examinations
as by transfer or promotion of trained and experienced
employees in the service who are familiar
with the workings of your Department and
especially with customs matters.</p>

<p class='c009' >To the Civil Service Commission:</p>

<p class='c009' >I am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd relative
to an examination for Special Agents to
the Treasury Department.</p>

<p class='c009' >I know you will pardon me if I insist that I
know better the necessary qualifications of Special
Agents than any person who knows nothing
about it whatever. If there were experienced
employees in the service who could be transferred
I certainly should do so rather than to
await an examination. You will remember a
personal interview I had with you about this
some months ago, and several requests, some of
them personal and some of them in writing followed
by the preparation of the questions in this
Department, still followed by oral inquiry to
which you courteously refer. I will explain
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_245' id='Page_245'>245</a></span>
again that I need some lawyers in the Special
Agent Force. The government loses millions
every year (and I speak within bounds) for
want of suitable preparation of cases for presentation
to the Board of General Appraisers.
I want men who know evidence when they see
it and who know how to present a case. I do
not want a physician or a preacher, but I do
want and must have lawyers. I care very little
whether they know anything about Customs
matters or not—they can learn that but they
may know everything about Customs matters
and cannot become lawyers. I have clerks in
the Department who have graduated in law but
that does not make a lawyer of a man. I know
what the Department needs, and I want that
need supplied. Please advise whether you will
hold the required examinations or whether I will
have to fill the vacancies with incompetent clerks,
or by executive order. If you will join in a
request that suitable men be put into this important
work by executive order I will let the
Civil Service Commission make the nominations
from a list which I will furnish, or I will ask
them to furnish the list and I will make the
nominations. I am not trying to escape the
Civil Service, for I heartily believe in it when
so applied as to bring material that can be used
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_246' id='Page_246'>246</a></span>
to bring results. I appreciate your expressed
desire to co-operate and I only ask that you
make it good by co-operating.</p>

<p class='c009' >The Secretary of the Treasury:</p>

<p class='c009' >The Commission has the honor to acknowledge
the receipt of your letter of the 5th inst.
in which are indicated your wishes with respect
to the proposed examination for Special Agents.</p>

<p class='c009' >In reply your attention is invited to the general
questions on government, law and customs
matters which have been submitted to the Commission
by your Department. Of the fifty-three
questions so submitted, fifteen are of a general
character and could be readily answered by any
law student. Only three relate to evidence in
any form. These are of such an elementary
character that they may be found in any text
book on the subject and are not sufficient to
bring out a satisfactory knowledge of evidence.
There are thirty-seven questions bearing directly
upon customs matters although your letters indicate
that a knowledge of the subject is not to be
required of applicants. After careful consideration
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_247' id='Page_247'>247</a></span>
of the matter and in view of your recent
letter it is believed that the questions submitted
by your Department are not suitable for an examination
of Special Agents.</p>

<p class='c009' ><i>After discussing the responsibility which the
Commission must bear the letter proceeds</i>:</p>

<p class='c009' >In this connection your attention is invited to
an examination for law clerk, Class 4, held for
your Department in April, 1903. This examination
was prepared along the lines indicated by
you and your statement that only graduates of
reputable law colleges who had had at least three
years practical experience subsequent to graduation
would be acceptable to the Department, was
incorporated in the announcement. The examination
consisted principally of practical questions
in law and the preparation of opinions
upon stated cases. Of the 367 persons who
competed only 20 attained eligibility. The results
of this examination were very unsatisfactory
to the Commission and to a large number
of the competitors who felt that injustice had
been done them. It is understood that several
persons who were regarded by the officials of
the Treasury Department as qualified for the
position failed in the examination. A large
number of appeals from the ratings were received,
some of them being from men who were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_248' id='Page_248'>248</a></span>
graduates of the best law schools in the country
and who had many years experience in the practice
of law in the general field.</p>

<p class='c009' ><i>Then follows reference to examinations for

<span class='sc'>XXIII</span>; <i>and the letter closes as follows</i>:</p>

<p class='c009' >The Commission is strongly of opinion that
in the entire force of the Treasury Department,
comprising as it does many thousand employees,
persons can be found who possess suitable qualifications
for Special Agents.</p>

<p class='c009' >To the Civil Service Commission:</p>

<p class='c009' >For three months I have been trying to get
some lawyers on the eligible list that I may improve
the Special Agent Service, and I am this
near success: I have had the solicitor for this
Department prepare a list of questions to be
submitted with others which the Commission
may be pleased to prepare. I have not examined
the questions. They were prepared by
Judge O’Connell, who has been a practicing
lawyer of extensive experience for twenty years,
and has several times served on the committee
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_249' id='Page_249'>249</a></span>
to examine applicants for admission to the Supreme
Court of his state. These questions your
Commission refused to use and declined to prepare
others. You tell me that I must fill the
vacancies from clerks in the Department. This
I will never do. The vacancies will remain while
I remain unless I can fill them in a way that in
my judgment will improve the service. Possibly
some clerk in your Department can prepare a
better list of questions than Judge O’Connell
has submitted. If so I have no objection. In
fact I have no objection to any course you may
be pleased to pursue and I have no further suggestions
to make. I only ask that some time
within a year or so the Civil Service Commission
get a few lawyers within reach for the special
service where lawyers are necessary. The government
loses millions every year for the want
of men in the Special Agent force, competent
to prepare cases for submission to the Board of
General Appraisers. If the Commission shall
elect to assist me in the premises I shall appreciate
it very much, and if it declines to act in
the future, as it has declined in the past I shall
submit, unless I can devise some other way to
improve the service.</p>

COMMISSION’S REJOINDER DATED DEC. 20, 1905.</div>

<p class='c009' >We are clear that vacancies in the position as
Special Agent cannot be satisfactorily filled by
open competitive examinations....</p>

<p class='c009' >... If it be your desire as indicated in
your letter that we should hold an examination
for law clerk we will do so; and if you wish to
make use of that register in filling vacancies in
the position as Special Agent, it is of course
your privilege to do so.</p>

      <div class='line'>Very respectfully,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>————</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Commissioner.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017' >Thereupon the Secretary of the Treasury
made request:</p>

<p class='c009' >“Replying to your letter of December 20th
handed to me by your Mr. —— and in harmony
with our verbal understanding I request
that the Civil Service Commission hold an examination,
giving it such name as it may deem
appropriate but so arranged as to exclude all
but graduates from law colleges, and who in
addition have had not less than three years experience
in active practice including trial of
cases in <i>Nisi Prius</i> Courts. I desire to make
use of these clerks as Special Agents. They
should be eligible for appointment direct or by
immediate transfer without waiting six months.
I need them now, and will be pleased if the
Commission will expedite the examination in
every possible way.”</p>

<p class='c009' >On December 29, 1905, the Commission submitted
draft of an announcement of an examination
for law clerks in the Treasury Department
and added: “It is requested that the announcement
be returned to this office at your
earliest convenience with such suggestions as
you may desire to make in regard thereto.”</p>

<p class='c009' >Suggestions were made January 4, 1906.</p>

<p class='c009' >“I suggest that you eliminate from the first
paragraph the following:</p>

<p class='c009' >‘In making certifications to positions in the
Customs Branch of the Treasury Department,
consideration will be given to experience showing
familiarity with Customs Law and practice
in Customs Cases.’</p>

<p class='c009' >There is not a lawyer in the United States
who has had experience in Customs Cases whom
I would appoint Special Agent, except those
who are earning five times what the position will
pay. There are some in the cities, and especially
in New York, quite a number of disreputable
fellows who have had some experience in practice
in Customs Cases, but there is not a New
York lawyer of experience in Customs Cases
whom I would appoint Special Agent except as
I say those who would not accept. I care nothing
for familiarity or practice in Customs Cases.
What I want is a man competent to practice in
Customs Cases, and with integrity enough to
justify his appointment.”</p>

<p class='c009' >As already stated, without fault of the Commission
no lawyer who had ever tried a case in
any court was ever made eligible and the Secretary
of the Treasury could secure one only
from the eligible list. There was an eligible list
of law clerks but no list of lawyers.</p>
